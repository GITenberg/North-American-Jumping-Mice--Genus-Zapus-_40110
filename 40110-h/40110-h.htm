INTRODUCTION</div>

<p>The jumping mice (Genus <i>Zapus</i>) are widely distributed over
northern North America, occurring as far north as the Arctic Circle
and as far south as Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona,
and central California. In some years these small rodents are
locally common in moist places that are either grassy or weedy; the
jumping mice are notable for the much enlarged hind legs and the
exceptionally long tail.</p>

<p>Members of the Genus as a whole have received no serious comprehensive
taxonomic attention in the 54 years since Preble&rsquo;s (1899)
revisionary work. In this time 15 new names have been proposed,
mostly for subspecies, and only a few attempts have been made at
grouping related named kinds.</p>

<p>In the present account it is aimed to record what is known concerning
geographic distribution, taxonomically significant characters,
and interrelationships of the known kinds as well as to provide means
for recognizing the species and subspecies in the genus. In addition,
attention is given to the probable center of origin of the subfamily
Zapodinae and to the relationships and taxonomic positions
of the genera <i>Zapus</i>, <i>Napaeozapus</i>, and <i>Eozapus</i>.</p>

<div class="caption2"><a name="MATERIALS_METHODS_AND_ACKNOWLEDGMENTS" id="MATERIALS_METHODS_AND_ACKNOWLEDGMENTS"></a>
MATERIALS, METHODS, AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</div>

<p>The present report is based on a study of approximately 3,600 specimens
that were assembled at the Museum of Natural History of the University of
Kansas or that were examined at other institutions. Most of these specimens
are stuffed skins with skulls separate. Skulls without skins, skins without skulls,
entire skeletons, and separately preserved bacula are included as a part of the
total. Almost every specimen is accompanied by an attached label, which bears
place and date of capture, name of collector, external measurements, and sex.</p>

<p>Specimens used in the study of geographic variation were arranged by season
of capture and according to geographic location; then they were segregated as
to sex, and, under each sex, by age. Next, individual variation was measured in
comparable samples of like age, sex, season, and geographic origin. Finally,
comparable materials were arranged geographically in order to determine variations
of systematic significance.</p>

<p>The only external measurements used were total length, length of tail, and
length of hind foot; these measurements were recorded by the collectors on the
labels attached to the skins. Height of the ear was not used since it was not
recorded by many of the collectors.</p>

<p>In order to determine which cranial structures showed the least individual
variation but at the same time showed substantial geographic variation, a statistical
analysis was made of the 30 measurements, of cranial structures, heretofore
used in taxonomic work on <i>Zapus</i>. The following measurements of the
skull showed the least individual variation but showed some geographic variation
and therefore, were used in this study. See <a href="#Figs_1-3">figs. 1-3</a> which show points
between which measurements were taken:</p>

projection of supraoccipital bone. <i>a</i> to <i>a&#180;</i></p>

parts of exoccipital condyles to a line connecting anteriormost projections
of premaxillary bones. <i>b</i> to <i>n</i></p>

across inferior ramus of zygomatic process of maxillary taken parallel
to long axis of skull. <i>d</i> to <i>e</i></p>

<p class="references"><i>Palatal breadth at M3.</i>&mdash;Greatest distance from inside margin of alveolus of
right M3 to its opposite. <i>g</i> to <i>g&#180;</i></p>

<p>The baculum has a characteristic size and shape according to the species,
and the following significant measurements of the structure were taken:</p>

<p class="references"><i>Greatest length.</i>&mdash;From posteriormost border of base to anteriormost point
on tip.</p>

<p class="references"><i>Greatest breadth at base.</i>&mdash;Greatest distance across base taken parallel to
long axis of bone.</p>

<p class="references"><i>Greatest breadth at tip.</i>&mdash;Greatest distance across tip taken parallel to long
axis of bone.</p>

<p>In the descriptions of color the capitalized color terms refer to those in
Ridgway (1912). Any color term that does not have the initial letter capitalized
does not refer to any one standard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>
<p>In the description of the subspecies the two sexes are treated as one because
no significant secondary sexual variation was found. Only fully adult specimens
of age groups 3 to 5, as defined on pages 377 and 388, have been considered.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise indicated, specimens are in the University of Kansas Museum
of Natural History. Those in other collections are identified by the

<p>The species are arranged from least to most progressive, and the subspecies
are arranged alphabetically.</p>

<p>The synonymy for each subspecies includes first a citation to the earliest
available name then one citation to each name combination that has been applied
to the subspecies and, finally, any other especially important references.</p>

<p>Marginal records of occurrence for each subspecies are shown on the maps
by means of hollow circles and these localities are listed in clockwise order beginning
with the northernmost locality. If more than one of these localities lies
on the line of latitude that is northernmost for a given subspecies the western-most
of these is recorded first. Marginal localities have been cited in a separate
paragraph at the end of the section on specimens examined in the account of a
subspecies. Localities that are not marginal are shown on the maps by solid
black circles. Localities that could not be represented on the distribution map
because of undue crowding or overlapping of symbols are italicized in the lists
of specimens examined and in the lists of marginal records.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>The localities of capture of specimens examined are recorded alphabetically
by state or province, and then by county in each state or province. Within a
county the specimens are recorded geographically from north to south. The
word &ldquo;County&rdquo; is written out in full when the name of the county is written on
the label of each specimen listed for that county, but the abbreviation &ldquo;Co.&rdquo; is
used when one specimen or more here assigned to a given county lacks the name
of the county on the label.</p>

<p>The following account has been made possible only by the kindness and cooperation
of those persons in charge of the collections listed above. For the
privilege of using the specimens in their care I am deeply grateful, as I am also
to Prof. A. Byron Leonard for assistance with <a href="#Figs_35-37">figures 35-37</a>, to Dr. Rufus Thompson
for <a href="#Figs_16-21">figures 16-21</a>, and to Mr. Victor Hogg who made all of the other illustrations.
My wife, Dorothy Krutzsch, helped untiringly in assembling data, in
typing the manuscript, and gave me continued encouragement. Finally, I am
grateful to Professor E. Raymond Hall for guidance in the study and critical
assistance in the preparation of the manuscript and to Professors Rollin H.
Baker, Robert W. Wilson, and Robert E. Beer for valued suggestions.</p>

PALEONTOLOGY OF THE GENUS</div>

<p>The fossil record of the genus <i>Zapus</i> is scanty. All of the known
fossils of it are lower jaws of Pleistocene Age. The Recent species
<i>Z. hudsonius</i> was recorded by Cope (1871:86) in the Port Kennedy
Cave fauna (pre-Wisconsinian) of Pennsylvania. Gidley and Gazin
(1938:67) reported a single mandibular ramus bearing m1-m3 recovered
from the Cumberland Cave (pre-Wisconsinian) of Maryland.
The teeth are not typical of modern <i>Zapus</i> in that m1 and m2
are shorter crowned and m1 has a longer anterior lobe. Gidley and
Gazin, nevertheless, considered their material insufficient for establishing
a new species.</p>

<p>Two extinct species have been described: <i>Zapus burti</i> Hibbard
(1941:215) from the Crooked Creek formation (= Meade formation
of the State Geological Survey of Kansas) mid-Pleistocene of Kansas
and <i>Zapus rinkeri</i> Hibbard (1951:351) from the Rexroad formation
(= Blanco formation of the State Geological Survey of Kansas) of
Blancan Age of Kansas. Both species resemble <i>Zapus hudsonius</i>,
but differ from it in broader crowned more brachydont cheek-teeth.
<i>Z. rinkeri</i> differs from <i>Z. burti</i> and <i>Z. hudsonius</i> by a more robust
ramus, broader molars, and three instead of two internal re-entrant
valleys posterior to the anterior loop on m1. The three species <i>Z.
rinkeri</i>, <i>Z. burti</i>, and <i>Z. hudsonius</i> are in a structurally, as well as a
geologically, progressive series. The trend in dentition is from
broad, brachydont cheek-teeth to narrow, semi-hypsodont cheek-teeth.</p>

RELATIONSHIPS, DISTRIBUTION, AND SPECIATION</div>

<div class="caption3">Relationships in the Subfamily Zapodinae</div>

<p>The subfamily Zapodinae is known from Pliocene and Pleistocene
deposits of North America and now occurs over much of northern
North America and in Szechuan and Kansu, China. The living
species occur among grasses and low herbs in damp or marshy places
both in forested areas and in plains areas.</p>

<p>The early Pliocene <i>Macrognathomys nanus</i> Hall (1930:305),
originally described as a Cricetid, is actually a Zapodid as shown by
the structure of the mandibular ramus, shape of the incisors, and
occlusal pattern of the cheek-teeth.</p>

<p>If <i>Macrognathomys</i> can be considered a member of the subfamily
Zapodinae (possibly it is a sicistine) then it represents the oldest
known member of this subfamily. Judging from the published illustrations,
<i>Macrognathomys</i> seems to be structurally ancestral to
the Mid Pliocene <i>Pliozapus solus</i> Wilson; the labial re-entrant folds
are wider and shorter and on m2 and m3 fewer. The difference in
stage of wear of the teeth in <i>Macrognathomys</i> and <i>Pliozapus</i> is a
handicap in comparing the two genera but they are distinct. Wilson
(1936:32) points out that <i>Pliozapus</i> clearly falls in the Zapodinae
and stands in an ancestral position with respect to the structurally
progressive series <i>Eozapus</i>, <i>Zapus</i>, and <i>Napaeozapus</i>. Nevertheless,
<i>Pliozapus</i> cannot be considered as directly ancestral to <i>Eozapus</i>
because of the progressive features in the dentition of <i>Pliozapus</i>.
Wilson (1937:52) remarked that if <i>Pliozapus</i> is ancestral to <i>Zapus</i>
and <i>Napaeozapus</i>, considerable evolution must have taken place in
the height of crown and in the development of the complexity of
the tooth pattern. In contrast to Wilson&rsquo;s opinion, Stehlin and
Schaub (1951:313) placed <i>Pliozapus</i> and <i>Eozapus</i> in the subfamily
Sicistinae because certain elements in the occlusal pattern of the
cheek-teeth are similar. I disagree with those authors and hold
with Wilson; I consider <i>Pliozapus</i> and <i>Eozapus</i> in the subfamily
Zapodinae. In dental pattern <i>Pliozapus</i>, as Wilson (1936:32)
pointed out, resembles the Recent Eurasiatic sicistid, <i>Sicista</i> more
than do <i>Zapus</i> or <i>Napaeozapus</i>. Nevertheless, from <i>Sicista</i> Wilson
distinguishes <i>Pliozapus</i> and relates it to the subfamily Zapodinae
by: "more oblique direction of protoconid-hypoconid ridge, anterior
termination of this ridge at buccal portion of protoconid
rather than between protoconid and metaconid as in <i>Sicista</i>; cusps
more compressed into lophs; cheek-teeth somewhat broader; greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
development of metastylid; greater development of hypoconulid
ridge, &#8230; absence of anteroconid&#8230;."</p>

<p><i>Eozapus</i> is more closely related to <i>Pliozapus</i> than to either <i>Zapus</i>
or <i>Napaeozapus</i> (Wilson, 1936:32) but all four genera are in the
subfamily Zapodinae. Stehlin and Schaub (op. cit.:158 and 311)
relate <i>Eozapus</i> to the subfamily Sicistinae on the basis of similarity
in the occlusal pattern of the cheek-teeth of <i>Eozapus</i> and various
sicistines. Stehlin and Schaub do not consider other structures such
as the elongate hind limbs, the shape of malleus and incus, and the
shape of the baculum, in which there is close resemblance to the
Zapodinae. It is these structural similarities as well as those, pointed
out by Wilson (<i>loc. cit.</i>), in dentition that leads me to place <i>Eozapus</i>
in the subfamily Zapodinae. The early Pleistocene <i>Zapus rinkeri</i>
Hibbard shows that the <i>Zapus</i> stage of development had already
been achieved perhaps as early as the late Pliocene. Hibbard
(1951:352) thought that <i>Zapus rinkeri</i> was not structurally intermediate
between <i>Pliozapus</i> and any Recent species of <i>Zapus</i>; although
the teeth of <i>Z. rinkeri</i> have the broader, shallower, re-entrant
folds of <i>Pliozapus</i>, these teeth are higher crowned and have an occlusal
pattern resembling that of the Recent species of <i>Zapus</i>. The
middle Pleistocene species, <i>Zapus burti</i> Hibbard, progressed essentially
to the structural level of the Recent <i>Zapus hudsonius</i>, but
the molars were more brachydont, broader crowned, and their
enamel folds less crowded. Pleistocene material of pre-Wisconsin
age obtained from cave deposits in Pennsylvania and Maryland is
most nearly like <i>Zapus hudsonius</i>. One such cave deposit in Maryland
contained an example of the Recent genus <i>Napaeozapus</i>, indicating
that its history dates from at least middle Pleistocene time.</p>

<p>The Asiatic Recent Genus, <i>Eozapus</i>, has not progressed much
beyond the Pliocene stage in zapidine evolution if <i>Pliozapus</i> be
taken as a standard; the North American Recent Genus <i>Zapus</i> essentially
achieved its present form by early Pleistocene times, and
the Recent Genus <i>Napaeozapus</i> achieved its more progressive structure
by middle Pleistocene times.</p>

<p>Perhaps <i>Pliozapus</i> and <i>Eozapus</i> represent one phyletic line and
<i>Zapus</i> and <i>Napaeozapus</i> a second line, both of which lines evolved
from a pre-zapidine stock in the Miocene. As mentioned earlier,
Wilson (1936) thinks that <i>Pliozapus</i> is not directly ancestral to
<i>Eozapus</i>. Possibly these two genera diverged at an early date;
nevertheless, they are closely related primitive forms.</p>

<p><i>Zapus</i> and <i>Napaeozapus</i> closely resemble each other and both are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
structurally advanced; <i>Napaeozapus</i> seems to have differentiated at
a more rapid rate.</p>

<p>According to Simpson (1947), the occurrence of the same group
of mammals on two different land masses is to be taken as prima
facie evidence that migration has occurred. Keeping in mind then
the present geographic distribution, unspecialized condition of the
dentition of <i>Eozapus</i>, and its resemblance to the extinct <i>Pliozapus</i>
known from North America but not from Asia, it may be that
<i>Eozapus</i> descended from primitive stock of a North American jumping
mouse that was forced to the periphery (across the Asiatic
North American land bridge) by the more specialized zapidine
stock.</p>

<p>Subsequently or perhaps during the migration of the pre-<i>Eozapus</i>
stock the zapidine stock may have dispersed transcontinentally,
occupying most of northern North America. The unprogressive
<i>Macrognathomys</i> and <i>Pliozapus</i> line which remained in North
America may have become extinct. Any such period of dispersal
and climatic equilibrium ended when glaciers came to cover most
of the northern part of the continent and the mammals living there
were forced southward by the ice or remained in ice-free refugia
within the glaciated area. Later, with melting and retreat of the
ice, the jumping mice could have again spread enough to occupy the
northern part of the continent. Such glaciation isolated segments
of the population and aided their evolution into distinct species.</p>

<p>If it be assumed, as Matthew (1915) did and as Hooper (1952:200)
later on the generic level did, that the region of origin and
center of dispersal for a given group of animals is characterized by
the presence of the most progressive forms, then southeastern
Canada and the northeastern United States make up the area of
origin and center of dispersal in relatively late time of the subfamily
Zapodinae. This area is inhabited by <i>Zapus hudsonius</i> and <i>Napaeozapus</i>,
the most progressive members of the subfamily.</p>

<p>As I visualize it, the evolution of the Zapodinae occurred in two
stages: the first stage involved the movement of the primitive pre-<i>Eozapus</i>
stock to Asia and the second stage involved the dispersal,
isolation, and specialization in North America of the more progressive
basic zapidine stock into the present genera <i>Zapus</i> and <i>Napaeozapus</i>.</p>


<div class="caption3">Status of the genera <i>Eozapus</i>, <i>Zapus</i>, and <i>Napaeozapus</i></div>

<p>The genus <i>Zapus</i> is one of three living genera in the subfamily

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
America and <i>Eozapus</i> from China have been variously considered

genera (Ellerman, 1940).</p>

<p>Note especially the variation in complexity of occlusal pattern, width of re-entrant
folds, and degree of tubercularity.</p>
</div>

<p>The remarkable similarity of the body form, post-cranial skeleton,
mandibular rami, and general structure of the cranium of <i>Zapus</i>,
<i>Napaeozapus</i>, and <i>Eozapus</i> indicate their relationship (see <a href="#Figs_4-15">figs.
4-15</a>); however, dissimilarity between the groups in the dentition
(tooth number and occlusal pattern), bacula, and ear ossicles provides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
basis for considering them distinct genera. As pointed out
earlier, <i>Zapus</i> and <i>Napaeozapus</i> appear to be more closely related
and progressive and the Asiatic <i>Eozapus</i> somewhat removed and
less progressive.</p>

<p><i>Teeth.</i>&mdash;According to the complexity in dental pattern and in
number and size of the cheek-teeth, these genera can be arranged
in a structurally progressive series with <i>Eozapus</i> showing the least
complexity and <i>Napaeozapus</i> the most (see <a href="#Figs_16-21">figs. 16-21</a>). There are
three distinct molar patterns; one is simple (<i>Eozapus</i>) and the
others (<i>Zapus</i> and <i>Napaeozapus</i>) are more complex. The complexity
is greatest in <i>Napaeozapus</i>, which is characterized by numerous
additional flexures in the enamel and dentine. The simplicity
of the molars of <i>Eozapus</i> is evident in the tuberculate rather than
flat-crowned occlusal surface; the wide, simple, re-entrant bays; the
small (or sometimes absent) anteroconid; and the essentially quadritubercular
nature of the teeth. The molars of <i>Zapus</i> and <i>Napaeozapus</i>
are flat crowned; however, <i>Zapus</i> has wider and fewer re-entrant
bays, a smaller anteroconid, and less complexity in the
occlusal pattern. The characteristics of the molar teeth would tend
to indicate a close relationship between <i>Zapus</i> and <i>Napaeozapus</i>
and to place <i>Eozapus</i> as primitive.</p>

<p>The absence of P4 in <i>Napaeozapus</i> would lead one to suspect
that this genus has evolved at a more rapid rate than the historically
older <i>Zapus</i> and <i>Eozapus</i> which still retain this structure. The small
size of P4, even in the primitive <i>Eozapus</i>, indicates that it has long
been of little use to the mouse. An even greater reduction of P4
in the more complex dentition of <i>Zapus</i> argues for complete loss of
this tooth as the next step in specialization, such as is seen in the
more progressive <i>Napaeozapus</i>. The following parallel columns
show selected differences between the occlusal patterns of the
cheek-teeth of the three genera:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baculum.</span>&mdash;The baculum (os penis) of <i>Eozapus</i> is known to me
only from Vinogradov&rsquo;s (1925) figures of the dorsal and lateral aspects.
The proximal end (base) is laterally expanded, and the
shaft tapers gradually toward the distal end where it expands
abruptly into the spade-shaped tip. In lateral aspect the bone is
relatively thick; it is curved downward slightly from the proximal
end to the base of the tip where it curves upward to a rounded point.</p>

<p>The baculum of <i>Zapus</i> differs from that of <i>Eozapus</i> as follows:
base less expanded horizontally; shaft slenderer; distal end less
spade-shaped except in <i>Z. trinotatus</i>. The tip is less expanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
in <i>Z. princeps</i> and is still less so in <i>Z. hudsonius</i>. In <i>Napaeozapus</i>
the tip is lanceolate, the base is narrow, and in lateral view the shaft
is slender and curved (see <a href="#Figs_22-31">figs. 22-31</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ear ossicles.</span>&mdash;The auditory ossicles are of three types which
differ only slightly. These ossicles possibly are more conservative
than some other structures because the ossicles are not so much
affected by the molding influence of the environment.</p>

<p>Instances of variation in the auditory region in mammals in general
are small, even at the family level; therefore, these differences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
in the subfamily Zapodinae are offered as additional support for
recognizing <i>Eozapus</i>, <i>Zapus</i>, and <i>Napaeozapus</i> as distinct genera.
The distinctive features are chiefly in the malleus and incus; the
stapes, however, differs slightly and, therefore, it too is described
(see <a href="#Figs_32-34">figs. 32-34</a>).</p>

<p>In <i>Eozapus</i> the head of the malleus is narrow, oblong, and
rounded dorsally and attaches to the body by a long, slender,
abruptly recurved neck. The body is weakly pointed ventrally and
rounded dorsally. A beaklike manubrium malleus composed of
anterior projecting external and internal spines extends from the
body to the tympanum. The incus has a dorsally rounded body with
an anterior downward snoutlike projection with which the malleus
articulates. The short limb of the incus is broad basally and
narrows somewhat distally. The long limb is narrow and its articulating
lenticular process is a flat circular structure. The limbs of the
stapes are wide-spread and heavy. The neck is short and wide with
a large circular articulating surface.</p>

<p>In <i>Zapus</i> the head of the malleus is angular with an anterior
projecting point and is flattened in dorsal aspect. The neck is
slender, elongate, and gently curved away from the long limb of the
incus. The body is pointed dorsally and rounded ventrally, the
reverse of the condition in <i>Eozapus</i>. There is a beaklike manubrium
malleus composed of internal and external anteriorly projecting
spines extending from the body to the tympanum as in <i>Eozapus</i>.
The incus has a rounded body with a long angular limb articulating
via a small lenticular process with the stapes. The short limb is
narrow but does not taper distally as in <i>Eozapus</i>. The limbs of the
stapes are relatively narrow, weak, and gently curved. The neck is
longer and more slender than that of <i>Eozapus</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>Napaeozapus</i> the head and neck of the malleus resemble those
of <i>Zapus</i> but are less robust. The body is more rounded dorsally,
having the curved dorsal surface directed anteriorly rather than
posteriorly (as in <i>Zapus</i>) and the lateral surface is nearly flat instead
of curved as in the other genera. The manubrium resembles
that of <i>Eozapus</i> and <i>Zapus</i>. The body of the incus is flattened dorsally
but otherwise rounded. The long limb of the incus is angular
and longer than that of <i>Zapus</i>. The short limb of the incus is broad
at the base and tapers distally. The limbs of the stapes are narrow,
weak, and abruptly curved. The neck is more slender and elongate
than in <i>Zapus</i>.</p>

<p>In summary: Only the head and body of the malleus and the
short and long limbs and body of the incus are sufficiently consistent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
within a given group to be of taxonomic importance. The similarity
in the morphology of these ossicles indicates a close relationship between
all three genera. <i>Zapus</i> and <i>Napaeozapus</i> resemble one another
more than either resembles <i>Eozapus</i>. The differences recorded
are constant between the described groups and, therefore, are considered
to be of taxonomic significance. The differences give basis
for dividing the subfamily Zapodinae into the three genera <i>Eozapus</i>,
<i>Zapus</i>, and <i>Napaeozapus</i>.</p>

<p>Distribution of and Speciation in the Genus <i>Zapus</i></p>

<p>Many of the described kinds of the genus <i>Zapus</i> were initially
named as distinct species (see Preble, 1899). Subsequently (see
Hall, 1931), some of the nominal species were reduced to the rank
of subspecies. Only three species in the genus <i>Zapus</i> are recognized
in the following account. The concept of species adopted here is,
in Mayr&rsquo;s (1942:120) words, this: &ldquo;Species are groups of actually
or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively
isolated from other such groups.&rdquo; The three species are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
<i>Z. trinotatus</i>, <i>Z. princeps</i>, and <i>Z. hudsonius</i>. No hybridization is
known where two occur together or where their ranges are adjacent.
Each of these species has several geographically contiguous subspecies.</p>

<p>The three species of <i>Zapus</i> are closely related but are not equally
progressive. If eastern North America is considered to be the region
of origin and center of dispersal of <i>Zapus</i> (see <a href="#Page_368">pp. 368-369</a>) the geographically
distant species would be expected to be the least progressive,
and such seems to be the case. <i>Zapus trinotatus</i> is geographically
farthest removed and structurally least progressive. <i>Zapus
hudsonius</i> occurs at the center of dispersal and is the most progressive
structurally whereas <i>Z. princeps</i> is geographically and structurally
intermediate. Structural progressiveness is postulated for
the species that has the simplest (in this instance specialized)
baculum and smallest fourth upper premolar. The phyletic
branches of the genus <i>Zapus</i> possibly developed from geographic
segments of a population radiating from the centrally located
progressive group. On continental areas where a species with a
wide and continuous range gives rise to several daughter species,
geographic isolation is thought to be important in bringing about
the formation of species. The unspecialized populations conceivably
occupied an area west of the present Rocky Mountains and
south of latitude 50&#176;. From later Miocene times on, climatic and
geological differentiation occurred in this area, and with the growth
of geological barriers and differentiation of habitat these unspecialized
populations may have been separated into two ecological
groups, one inhabiting the more arid area between the present
Rocky Mountains and the present Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada
and the other group inhabiting the Pacific coastal region. Isolation
of each of these groups probably was not complete. How far differentiation
might have proceeded with incomplete isolation can
only be guessed, but at least incipient differences probably were
present and possibly the animals approached in character those
found in these areas today in that the ecology of the region was
much the same as now.</p>

<p>In the region between the Rocky Mountains and the present
Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada, the flora (in late Pliocene)
became semidesert, which presumably made most of this region
uninhabitable for jumping mice. The aridity probably induced
local concentration into boreal montane islands, thus possibly displacing
the populations of the two species that were in contact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>In Pleistocene times continental glaciation must have interrupted
the contacts between the coastal, intermontane (the area between
the present Rocky Mountains and the present Cascade Range and
the Sierra Nevada), and northern and eastern groups of <i>Zapus</i> or
mammals of any genus that occurred over all of this vast region.
The advance of the ice southward would have increased opportunity
for evolution by interposing barriers that isolated some populations.
The populations possibly were re-established in interglacial
periods and then were isolated again by another descent of glacial
ice.</p>

<p>If a population occupied the unglaciated coastal region of Oregon
and Washington it may have been separated from other populations
to the north and east by an ice cap which covered most of the Cascade
Range. The population occupying the intermountain region
probably was isolated from the population to the north and west.
The formation of glaciers presumably reduced the size of areas
available to the populations occupying eastern North America,
Alaska, and Canada with the result that they persisted only in areas
south of the ice or in ice-free refugia (central and western Alaska)
within the glaciated area. According to Axelrod (1948), the flora
in the eastern United States during the Pleistocene furnished most
of the stock for the revegetation of southern and subarctic Canada
east of the Rocky Mountains. Eastern populations of <i>Z. hudsonius</i>
(or its progenitors) probably followed the spread of this vegetation
and, thus, extended their range into Canada where they crossbred
with populations advancing south and east from the refugia in
Alaska. Western montane floras, which extended north along the
Rocky Mountains and the Cascade and Coast ranges, probably
paved the path for a northward migration of populations of the
intermountain <i>Z. princeps</i> (or its progenitors). Populations of
<i>Z. princeps</i> moved eastward from the present Rocky Mountains,
inhabiting the high plains of southern Canada and the north-central
United States. In general, <i>Zapus hudsonius</i> occupies the region to
the north and to the east of that inhabited by <i>Zapus princeps</i>; however,
the ranges of the two meet and overlap in central and northern
British Columbia and in the high plains area of southern Alberta,
Saskatchewan, eastern Manitoba, eastern Montana, North Dakota,
and northern South Dakota. In these places of overlap, owing to
range expansion following the retreat of the ice, there is no sign of
interbreeding, indicating that the populations have attained specific
rank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>Populations of both <i>Z. hudsonius</i> and <i>Z. princeps</i> occur together
at Indianpoint Lake, British Columbia. Specimens taken there are
readily sorted into two groups; none is intermediate. The difference
in size between these species there is especially marked; <i>Z. p. saltator</i>
there is a large derivative of <i>Z. princeps</i> and <i>Z. h. tenellus</i> is a
medium-sized <i>Z. hudsonius</i>.</p>

<p><i>Z. princeps</i> minor and <i>Z. hudsonius intermedius</i> have been taken
at several neighboring localities in North Dakota. Although these
geographic races are more nearly of the same size (<i>minor</i> is a small
subspecies of <i>princeps</i> and <i>intermedius</i> is a moderately large subspecies
of <i>hudsonius</i>) they do not interbreed. Specimens of <i>Z. p.
minor</i> and <i>Z. h. intermedius</i> have been obtained from an ecologically
homogeneous area in the vicinity of Fort Totten and Devils
Lake, North Dakota. Values obtained from several measurements
of the skull and baculum allow for ready recognition of the two
species. The populations from North Dakota are, however, not so
widely divergent as are those populations from the area of contact
in British Columbia. Perhaps the difference in the degree of distinction
between the species at the two areas of contact is indicative
of the length and completeness of geographic isolation between
neighboring populations.</p>

<p>The ranges of <i>Z. trinotatus</i> and <i>Z. hudsonius</i> are not at present
in contact, but the two species differ more strongly than do <i>hudsonius</i>
and <i>princeps</i> or <i>princeps</i> and <i>trinotatus</i>. Therefore, <i>trinotatus</i>
and <i>hudsonius</i> are here considered to be two distinct species.</p>

<p>As pointed out earlier in this discussion, the separation between
the progenitors of <i>Z. trinotatus</i> and <i>Z. princeps</i> probably occurred
when the present Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada were being
formed. From this time until Pleistocene glaciation an incomplete
geographic isolation was in effect between the populations of the
Pacific coast and the intermountain populations. Perhaps in the
region north of the present Cascade Range there was moderate interbreeding
between these populations and the transcontinental form.
There may have been a similar zone of interbreeding along the crest
of the present Cascades where the intermountain and coastal populations
conceivably could have met. At least incipient characters
probably were present when in Pleistocene time, continental glaciation
further isolated the two populations. Since the retreat of the
last ice (Wisconsin) the unprogressive coastal <i>Z. trinotatus</i> has
expanded its range only slightly, reaching as far as southwestern
British Columbia. It seems that ecological difference rather than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
the barrier formed by the higher elevations is responsible for the
limited expansion of range. The population of <i>princeps</i> has extended
its range northward to the southern part of the Yukon Territory
but does not occur in coastal southern British Columbia because
that area already was occupied by <i>Zapus trinotatus</i>. The ranges of
the two species meet and overlap in southwestern British Columbia.
The species occur sympatrically in Manning Park where, according
to Carl <i>et al.</i> (1952:77), they occupy the same range in the region
of Allison Pass, Pinewoods, and Timberline Valley. These workers
remark that no intergradation was apparent between individuals
of the two species obtained in the same trap line.</p>

<p>I have examined material of both species from Allison Pass.
There the species differ in color, in the shape of the skull, and in
the size and shape of the baculum. Material from Timberline
Valley, an area in which Carl <i>et al.</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) reported both species,
here is assigned to <i>Z. princeps</i>. Where bacula have been preserved
the identity of the species is instantly possible.</p>

<p>In summary: First, a population of jumping mice, possibly a
monotypic genus, occurred over most of North America; then this
population partly divided into Pacific northwest, intermountain
(from the east slopes of the present Rocky Mountains to the east
slopes of the present Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada), and
transcontinental (eastern and northern) groups with the least progressive
groups peripheral; a further reduction or possibly a complete
isolation of these populations followed owing to Pleistocene
glaciation (especially in the Wisconsin period); and, finally, the
present day contacts were established between these populations
which by now have differentiated into species. Conceivably, <i>Z.
burti</i> (Blancan age) and <i>Z. rinkeri</i> (mid Pleistocene) may represent
stages in the development of <i>Z. hudsonius</i>.</p>

<div class="caption2"><a name="CHARACTERS_OF_TAXONOMIC_WORTH" id="CHARACTERS_OF_TAXONOMIC_WORTH"></a>
CHARACTERS OF TAXONOMIC WORTH</div>

<p><span class="smcap">External parts.</span>&mdash;The total length, the length of the tail, and
the length of the hind foot are useful to some extent in distinguishing
species and subspecies. Geographic variation in these measurements
is clinal in some species. For example, <i>Zapus trinotatus</i>,
which inhabits the western coast of North America, decreases in
size from the northern to the southern part of its range. There is
considerable overlap in external measurements, in specimens of the
same age, between the species <i>Z. trinotatus</i> and <i>Z. princeps</i>, but
only slight overlap between <i>Z. princeps</i> and <i>Z. hudsonius</i> and between
<i>Z. trinotatus</i> and <i>Z. hudsonius</i>. If all collectors measured external
parts in the same way the measurements would be more useful
for differentiating one species from another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelage.</span>&mdash;The pelage, both in its entirety and as individual hairs,
provides taxonomic characters as has been pointed out by Moojen
(1948:324) for the genus <i>Proechimys</i>, by Williams (1938:239) for
the Insectivora, and by Hausman (1920:496) for several groups of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
mammals. In addition to the sensory hairs, facial vibrissae, nasal
hairs, and carpal vibrissae, there are three kinds of hairs in the normal
coat of <i>Zapus</i>: guard hairs, overhairs, and underfur. The
guard hairs and underfur differ in different species (see <a href="#Figs_35-37">figs. 35-37</a>).</p>

<p>The guard hairs taper at both ends, are elliptical in cross section,
and are wider and longer than the other two kinds of hair. The
bases of the guard hairs are grayish, and the amount of pigment
gradually increases distally to a dark brownish or blackish shade.
The guard hairs vary in greatest diameter from 96 microns to 168
microns, depending upon the species, and variation in diameter
provides characters of taxonomic worth. No clinal variation in
diameter of the guard hairs was detected. In <i>Z. hudsonius</i> the guard
hairs average 115 microns (96-140) and are significantly narrower
than those of <i>Z. princeps</i> and <i>Z. trinotatus</i>, which average 142
microns (130-168) and 141 microns (133-154), respectively. Pigmentation
of the guard hairs contributes little information useful in
separating the species of <i>Zapus</i>. All of the species have a prominent
compounded medulla in which the pigment cells anastomose to
form a labyrinthine column.</p>

<p>The individual hair of the underfur is cylindrical and tapers
abruptly at each end; it is short, thin, flexible, and usually is bicolored
on the back and sides of the mouse. The apical zone is
yellow-brown (for example, Ochraceous-Buff) and the proximal
part is whitish or grayish, which gradually darkens to near black
subapically.</p>

<p>The width of a hair in the underfur is of no taxonomic significance,
in that individual variation exceeds that between species.</p>

<p>The pattern of the pigment in the medulla of the hair, however,
does vary specifically. Comparable samples from <i>Z. trinotatus</i>,
<i>Z. princeps</i>, and <i>Z. hudsonius</i> of the same age, sex, and season reveal
a pattern characteristic for each species (see <a href="#Figs_35-37">figs. 35-37</a>).</p>

<p>All species of <i>Zapus</i> agree closely in color pattern. A broad
longitudinal dorsal band of some shade of yellow-brown flecked
with black hairs is bordered by a lateral band of a lighter color
usually containing fewer black hairs than on the dorsum. The
underparts are usually white but are sometimes suffused with color
resembling that on the sides. Between the white underparts and
the darker color of the sides there is often a narrow, clear ochraceous
stripe. Dorsal and lateral hairs are uniformly grayish-white at their
bases; only the distal parts of the hairs are responsible for the external
color of the animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>The pelage of juveniles is usually finer and softer than the pelage
of adults. The lateral and dorsal bands are not so conspicuously
marked in young animals, and individual hairs are not so long or so
wide as in adult animals.</p>

<p>Preble (1899:7) and Howell (1920:226) remark as to the noticeable
difference between pelages of spring and early fall. The pelage
in spring is described as bright and fresh whereas that in fall is dull
and worn. Actually both bright and worn pelages can occur in any
one population at any one time. Some newly molted individuals
are in fresh unworn pelage; some individuals, which are molting,
are in ragged, worn pelage; and other individuals perhaps could
be found to represent intermediate stages.</p>

<p>Variations from the normal color of the pelage are rare. Among
more than 3,000 specimens of <i>Zapus</i> examined there were only 12
individuals (five <i>Z. princeps</i>, 6 <i>Z. hudsonius</i>, and 1 <i>Z. trinotatus</i>)
that were abnormally colored. A single white spot was noted on
each of 10 (5 <i>Z. princeps</i>, 4 <i>Z. hudsonius</i>, and 1 <i>Z. trinotatus</i>) of these
individuals; the spots were on the dorsal, anterior half of the body.
The skin beneath the patch of white hair was in each animal like
that beneath the neighboring normally-pigmented hair. One specimen
of <i>Z. hudsonius</i> (NMC No. 6669) is everywhere black, excepting
the dorsal surface of the toes of the forefeet. Most of the individual
hairs from various areas of the body are black for their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
entire length; some, however, have non-pigmented silvery tips. One
specimen of <i>Z. hudsonius</i> (KU No. 645) lacks any black; dorsally
the pelage is nearest to Ochraceous-Buff and it is white on the venter.
Individual hairs of the dorsal area are white for the basal two-thirds
of their length (as compared to gray and brown in the animals
with normal pigmentation) and near Ochraceous-Buff on the distal
third (as compared to hairs which are dark brown tipped with
Ochraceous-Buff). The feet and tail are white.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Molt.</span>&mdash;The sequence of molt for <i>Zapus</i> has been ascertained
from examination of the study skins. In all species of this genus
there seems to be only one annual molt in adults. In the young of
the year this molt occurs after August first and before hibernation.
All individuals of a single population do not molt at any one time;
females continue to molt later in the autumn than do the males;
some individuals begin the molt as early as mid-June and others
show molt as late as the end of October; approximately three weeks
are required for an individual to complete its molt (Quimby, 1951:74);
readiness for molt and early stages in molt can be detected (in
museum specimens) by the greater thickness of the skin. Hairs lost
accidentally are quickly replaced, regardless of the condition of the
molt.</p>

<p>In <i>Zapus hudsonius</i>, new hair appears simultaneously on the anterior
dorsal surface of the nose and on the mid-dorsal surface between
the scapulae. The molt proceeds anteriorly from the shoulders
and posteriorly from the nose. At the same time that the head
is covered, new hair appears on the sides of the body from the forelegs
to the cheeks. New pelage then appears posteriorly, and molt
continues as a wave from these points over the sides and back with
the rump receiving new hair last (see <a href="#Figs_38-43">figs. 42 and 43</a>).</p>

<p>In <i>Zapus princeps</i> new hair appears first on the mid-dorsal surface
between the scapulae. From this starting point molt progresses
anteriorly, laterally, and posteriorly. Progress over the head is
rapid; the head receives its new hair sooner than the caudal region.
Molt moves progressively nearer to the base of the tail and progressively
nearer to the mid-ventral surface. The rump is the last area
to complete its molt (see <a href="#Figs_38-43">figs. 40 and 41</a>).</p>

<p>The progress of molt in <i>Z. princeps</i> might be likened to the flow
of a drop of paint on the curved surface of a ball where the paint
flows in all directions but is speeded at one point and slowed at the
opposite by a slight tilting of the ball from the horizontal.</p>

<p>In the species <i>Zapus trinotatus</i> new hair appears simultaneously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
on the anterior, dorsal surface of the nose and on the mid-dorsal
surface between the scapulae. In this respect the progress of molt
of <i>Z. trinotatus</i> resembles that of <i>Z. hudsonius</i>. From these starting
points molt progresses rapidly over the head, the molt moving anteriorly
from the shoulders and posteriorly from the nose with the
result that it covers the dorsal surface of the head; hair then appears
on the cheeks and sides of the neck. The progress of molt on the
remaining areas of the body is comparable to that of <i>Z. princeps</i>;
molt progresses toward the tail and toward the mid-ventral line.
The rump, as in <i>Z. princeps</i>, is the last area to complete its molt
(see <a href="#Figs_38-43">figs. 38 and 39</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baculum.</span>&mdash;The general shape and dimensions of the baculum
(os penis) provide characters of taxonomic value for the species of
<i>Zapus</i> (see <a href="#Figs_22-31">figs. 23-25</a> and <a href="#Figs_22-31">figs. 28-30</a>).</p>

<p>Three measurements&mdash;length, transverse diameter at the base,
and transverse diameter at the tip&mdash;are easily obtained and are
diagnostic. The bacula of all species are somewhat curved. The
measurement of length used by me does not represent the actual
length of the bone, but instead the chords of the arcs involved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skull.</span>&mdash;Some of the structures useful for separating taxonomic
entities may have little or no biological significance to the animals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
in nature. Characters mentioned by me are chosen simply for their
significance taxonomically. The zygomata vary in degree of lateral
bowing, being widely bowed in <i>Z. princeps</i> and <i>Z. trinotatus</i>, and
less so in <i>Z. hudsonius</i>. Differences in zygomatic breadth owing to
the degree of bowing are an aid in differentiating subspecies. The
length of the skull from the occipital condyles to the tip of the
longest nasal bone is useful in separating <i>Z. hudsonius</i> from <i>Z.
trinotatus</i> and <i>Z. princeps</i>. The narrowness of the base of the
zygomatic process of the squamosal is useful in distinguishing
between <i>Z. hudsonius</i> and <i>Z. princeps</i>, but shows no variation of
subspecific worth. The shape and dimensions of the incisive
foramina provide specific and subspecific characters. The position
of the anterior margin of the postpalatal notch, in relation to the last
molars, provides subspecific characters in <i>Z. princeps</i>. In the species
<i>Z. princeps</i> the median projection on the inferior ramus of the
zygomatic process of the maxillary is absent in some subspecies,
small in others, and large in some. Shape and inflation of the
auditory bullae, shape of the pterygoid fossae, and shape of the
nasals are useful in determining specific and subspecific relationships.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teeth.</span>&mdash;The alveolar length of the upper maxillary tooth-rows
aids in distinguishing <i>Z. hudsonius</i> from <i>Z. princeps</i> and <i>Z. trinotatus</i>.
Nearly parallel versus anteriorly divergent upper tooth-rows is a
subspecific difference in <i>Z. princeps</i>. Variations in the dimensions
of P4 and M1 aid in estimating the relationships of species. The
occlusal pattern shows little variation and was of no use in separating
species.</p>




<div class="caption2"><a name="NONGEOGRAPHIC_VARIATION" id="NONGEOGRAPHIC_VARIATION"></a>
NONGEOGRAPHIC VARIATION</div>


<p>A knowledge of variation resulting from age, individual, or secondary sexual
differences, as opposed to geographic variation between two or more populations
of a single species is important in determining the reliability of taxonomic
characters.</p>

<p>The largest population-sample of <i>Zapus</i> available to me for the study of
nongeographic variation was 63 individuals from various localities in Keweenaw
and Menominee counties, Michigan. Thirty-nine were females and 24 were
males. It is on these specimens that this discussion is based.</p>


<div class="caption3">Age Variation</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Teeth.</span>&mdash;The teeth provide a valuable standard for age determination in
that they wear at a measurable rate. The molars erupt in sequence from front
to back, and wear shows first on M1 and last on M3. The peglike permanent
P4, of which I have not seen the deciduous precursor, receives wear at the
same time that the molars are being worn. Wear proceeds at approximately
the same rate in the teeth of both the upper jaws and lower jaws.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to be more nearly certain that specimens used in making racial
comparisons were comparable as to age, six age-groups were established, from
youngest to oldest. These groups were based on the degree of wear on the
occlusal surface of the upper cheek-teeth, and are as follows: group 1, in
which M1 and M2 have not reached full and equal height and show no
occlusal wear, and M3 has not erupted or is just breaking through the alveolus;
group 2, in which M1 and M2 have reached full and equal height and show
slight wear, and M3 may be almost or quite equal in height to M1 and M2
and, when equal, sometimes shows slight wear; group 3, in which M1 and M2
show wear on all cusps but cusps are visible, and M3 shows slight wear;
group 4, in which P4 shows slight wear, M1 has cusps and re-entrant folds
between cusps mostly gone, M2 shows considerable wear but re-entrant folds
are visible, and M3 has most re-entrant folds and cusps gone; group 5, in which
P4 shows considerable wear, M1 has cusps completely worn away, M2 has re-entrant
folds and cusps worn away, and M3 lacks occlusal pattern except for
one or two lakes; group 6, in which all upper cheek-teeth are without occlusal
pattern.</p>

<p>These groupings are based on continuously variable features, and, therefore,
when the teeth are at certain stages of wear a specimen is difficult to
place in one of two groups.</p>

<p>Age group 1 and 2 include juvenal and subadult animals. Animals of age
groups 3 through 6 are considered adult. Individuals of age groups 3 through
5, including as they do the great majority of the adult population, were the
only age classes used in measuring geographic variation.</p>

<p>Quimby&rsquo;s (1951:69) data indicate that some mice produce litters at the
age of approximately 2 months, when four-fifths grown. Therefore, sexual
maturity is not always synonymous with morphological maturity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Measurements of external parts.</span>&mdash;Data presented here on <i>Z. hudsonius</i>
are those recorded by Quimby (1951) on specimens from Anoka County,
Minnesota, and those obtained by me from museum specimens from Menominee
and Keweenaw counties, Michigan.</p>

<p>According to Quimby (1951:65-66) the mean length [= body length] for
three newly born <i>Z. hudsonius</i> is 24.8 mm (24.0-25.5); at the end of the
fourth week of growth the mean length averaged 64.4 mm and at the 13th
week 77.6 mm. Rapid growth occurs during the first four weeks, with the
mean length increasing approximately 2.6 times the size at birth. After the
fourth week of development, growth proceeds at a slower rate; the mean
length at 13 weeks is only 3.1 times greater than the mean length at birth.</p>

<p>In specimens assigned to age groups 1 and 2 the length of the body averaged
70 and 74.8 mm, respectively. The individuals of both groups are less
than 13 weeks old if we assume that growth proceeds at the same rate in
Michigan as it does in Minnesota.</p>

<p>In the specimens from Michigan of age groups 3, 4, 5, and 6 the average
length of the body is 80.9, 83.7, 89.0, and 83.6, respectively.</p>

<p>According to Quimby (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the average length of the tail for three
<i>Z. hudsonius</i> at birth was 9.2 mm. (8.5-10.0). During the first four
weeks of development the tail grew rapidly and reached an average length of
92.0 mm, which was 10 times the length at birth. By the end of 13 weeks of
development the average length of the tail for these three individuals was
119.6 mm or 12 times the average length at birth. The most rapid growth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
was early in development: 80 per cent of the growth of the tail occurred during
the first month, after which growth proceeded at a much slower rate.</p>

<p>Quimby (<i>loc. cit.</i>) records an average dimension of 4.7 mm (4.5-5.0)
for the length of the hind foot in three newly born <i>Z. hudsonius</i>. The hind
foot grew rapidly in length and by the fourth week had increased 5.6 times in
its length and averaged 26.3 mm. Growth was much less rapid from the
fourth to the thirteenth week when the hind foot averaged 27.7 mm, only five
per cent more than in mice four weeks old. Assuming the average length of
the hind foot of the adults to be 29.0 mm, the hind foot in individuals 13
weeks old is 96 per cent of the adult size.</p>

<p>According to Quimby (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the pinna of the ear at birth is small and
folded over the external auditory meatus. The length of the ear increases proportionately
more (29 per cent) than any other external dimension after the
first four weeks of growth.</p>

<p>If the average length of the ear (measured from the crown) of adults is
14.7 mm, the animals from Michigan in age groups 1 and 2 are 91.8 per cent
and 96.5 per cent as large as adults.</p>

<p>From these data, concerning growth of external parts, it seems that: growth
is most rapid during the four weeks following parturition; specimens from
Michigan, assigned to age groups 1 and 2 on the basis of tooth wear, are less
fully developed and probably younger than mice from Minnesota, with a known
age of 13 weeks; individuals with sufficient wear on the teeth to be placed
in age group 3, if they were obtained in the late fall, may be young from the
first litters of the year or, if they were obtained in early spring, may be at
least one year old; individuals in age groups 4, 5, and 6 are at least one year
old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skull.</span>&mdash;The post-embryonic development of the skull is rapid. Animals
in age groups 1 and 2 have skulls which average more than 80 per cent of the
size that is here considered adult (an average size obtained from age groups
3, 4, and 5). The actual increase in size of certain cranial elements for
various age groups is given in <a href="#Table_2">table 2</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>In age group 1 the rostrum is relatively short as it is in <i>Neotoma micropus</i>
(J. A. Allen, 1894:235) and juveniles of <i>Peromyscus truei</i> (Hoffmeister, 1951:7).
The rostrum lengthens rapidly and there is a general increase in actual
and relative size of the entire preorbital region; the increase after age group 3
is slower and of lesser magnitude. Changes with age in the size of the braincase
are slight. In age group 1 the average depth of the braincase is 99.6 per
cent of the adult size; the average breadth of the braincase is 98 per cent of the
adult size, and the average width across the mastoid region is 96.4 per cent of
the adult size. These dimensions indicate that the braincase reaches full size
early. The zygomatic arch, however, undergoes change with age; there is a
gradual increase in breadth owing to lateral bowing and a gradual lengthening
which is in keeping with a general elongation of the skull anterior to the
braincase.</p>

<p>The incisive foramina in age group 1 are short (4.0 mm), broad (2.2 mm in
the middle), and taper to a point at each end. In age group 2 the foramina
have elongated (4.2 mm) and are less pointed posteriorly, but there is no
change in breadth. In age groups 3, 4, 5, and 6 the foramina become progressively
longer (4.5 mm in age group 6), have a relatively constant breadth
(2.2 mm), and become more nearly truncate anteriorly.</p>

<div class="caption3">Individual Variation</div>

<p>Measurements of external parts in <i>Zapus</i> are more variable than are measurements
of most parts of the skull. As Hoffmeister (1951:16) points out for
<i>Peromyscus truei</i>, this variation in external features results in part from &ldquo;the
difficulties in accurately measuring soft parts of the anatomy&rdquo; and also from
inconsistencies on the part of collectors in making these measurements.</p>

<p>A comparison of coefficients of variation (see <a href="#Table_3">table 3</a>) for cranial measurements
between populations of like age and sex for the species <i>Z. hudsonius</i>,
<i>Z. princeps</i>, and <i>Z. trinotatus</i> shows that variation of approximately the same
degree is recorded in corresponding elements in all species; that is to say,
structures which are most variable individually in <i>Z. princeps</i> are also most
variable in <i>Z. trinotatus</i> and <i>Z. hudsonius</i>.</p>

<p>Individual variation in the occlusal pattern of the molariform teeth is slight.
In several specimens, however, the re-entrant fold is absent from the lingual
surface of M1. Teeth in addition to the normal number were recorded for
five specimens. In all instances they are in the upper dentition and usually
at the posterior end of the maxillary tooth-row. In each of four specimens
(KU No. 34852, KU No. 32852, MVZ No. 52105, all <i>Z. princeps</i>, and USBS
No. 22921, <i>Z. hudsonius</i>), there is only a single additional tooth. One individual
(USBS No. 264388, <i>Z. princeps</i>) possessed two extra molars, one in
each maxillary tooth-row. The extra teeth vary in size from those which are
only slightly smaller than the adjacent normal molars to those which are simple,
peglike structures. In four of the five animals the extra teeth are posterior to
the normal M3; in the fifth (MVZ No. 52105) the added tooth is anteriormedial
to M3.</p>

<p>The size and shape of certain cranial elements vary individually even between
right and left sides of the same animal. The paired parietal bones in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
some animals are nearly square and identical. In other animals these bones
are approximately equal and straight on three sides with the fourth side forming
an anterolateral projection; this projection may be slightly or greatly produced,
and opposite elements in a single individual differ in this respect.</p>

<p>The interparietal also is variable; the lateral arms may be blunted and not
included in the fusion of the squamosal, parietal, and occipital elements, or the
interparietals may be elongated and fused with these elements. Posterior and
anterior borders of the interparietal may be straight, produced anteriorly, produced
posteriorly, or produced anteriorly and posteriorly.</p>

<p>There is frequently variation in the degree of taper of the nasals. They may
be parallel sided, narrowed distally, or narrowed proximally. There is some
variation in the degree of inflation, in the size, and in the shape of the frontal
bones. The anterior surface of the postpalatal notch varies individually and
may be truncate, anteriorly convex, or anteriorly concave.</p>

<p>Individual variation in the color of the pelage of animals that are in the
same stage of molt or non-molt is by my observation slight. The presence of
oil in the hair results in a false impression of sleekness and seemingly darker
pigmentation. Abnormal white-spotting dorsally occurs as does yellow and
melanistic coat color. These mutations are considered in the discussion concerning
pelage.</p>


<div class="caption3">Secondary Sexual Variation</div>

<p>In specimens of the two sexes from similar age groups of <i>hudsonius</i> from
Michigan, the mean values for each measurement for the two sexes differ only
slightly or are essentially the same (see <a href="#Table_4">table 4</a>). In no species has secondary
sexual variation been found to be greater than individual variation.</p>

loop incompletely enclosing single central cusp; m3 relatively large, elongated;
m1 elongated, broadly rounded anteriorly.</p>


<div class="caption3">GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION</div>

<p>There are four subspecies currently recognized, all of which are
confined to the Pacific coastal region of North America (See <a href="#Fig_45">fig. 45</a>).
The features that vary geographically are external size, color of
pelage (shade and tone of upper parts and tint of lower parts), and
dimensions of certain cranial structures (zygomata, braincase, incisive
foramina, palatal bridge, auditory bullae, and pterygoid
fossae).</p>

<p>External size is smallest in the southernmost geographic race
(<i>Z. t. orarius</i>) and largest in the northernmost geographic race
(<i>Z. t. trinotatus</i>). This decrease in size from north to south is clinal
and is in keeping with Bergman&rsquo;s Rule which postulates that within
one species the smallest individuals occur in the warmer parts of its
geographic range.</p>

<p>Coloration of pelage is geographically variable. There is a
gradual change in the color of the pelage from north to south.
Animals obtained in the northern part of the geographic range of
<i>Z. trinotatus</i> are generally darker dorsally (more tawny) with the
ventral pelage usually pure white. Those individuals from the
southern part of the geographic range of <i>Z. trinotatus</i> have the dorsal
pelage lighter (more reddish and yellow-brown) and ventrally the
pelage is usually heavily suffused with reddish-brown. The crania
also vary geographically; they are largest in the northernmost part
of the range of the species and smallest in the southernmost part.</p>


<div class="caption3">NATURAL HISTORY</div>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&mdash;On the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, in 1931 Svihla
and Svihla (1933:132) found this species equally abundant in alpine
meadows near timberline, in open grassy areas, and in tall meadow
grass and low blueberry bushes. All of the mice were in wet marshy
places. Bailey (1936:232) reported that in Oregon, these mice live
in meadows, marshes, under ferns and weeds in the woods, or near
mountain brooks and streams. Taylor (1922:221) found <i>Zapus</i> in
moderately moist meadows in the Hudsonian Life-zone at Mt.
Rainier, Washington, and Dice (1932:49) found them in deciduous
forest and in open, grassy, or sphagnum bogs. Dice records it as
common also among the alders and willows in high, open, grassy
parks. Merriam (1897b:223) found <i>Z. trinotatus</i> abundantly in moist
places grown-over with grass or weeds. Grass cuttings two to three
inches long were left in small heaps at feeding sites and indicate
the presence of these mice.</p>

<p><i>Behavior.</i>&mdash;Svihla and Svihla (1933:131) write that the long tail of
<i>Z. trinotatus</i> is used as a balancing organ when the mouse is in motion.
A tailless mouse, attempting to escape, turned somersaults
in the air and invariably landed on its back; the loss of its tail
seemed to leave the mouse without compensation for the vigorous
push of the hind legs. Dalquest (1948:371) noted that the jumping
mouse sometimes walks on all fours, but ordinarily moves by means
of short hops on the hind feet alone. When startled, jumping mice
travel in bounds of six feet or more at a jump.</p>

<p><i>Zapus trinotatus</i>, according to Bailey (1936:232) and Elliot
(1899:261), is mainly nocturnal but occasionally is active in daylight.</p>

<p>Svihla and Svihla (<i>op. cit.</i>:132) heard captive animals make
squeaking noises when fighting. On several occasions captive animals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
made a drumming noise by rapidly beating the tail against a
resonant body such as the bottom of a tin can.</p>

<p>Concerning hibernation, Bailey (<i>loc. cit.</i>) remarks that animals
of this species in Oregon, become fat in early autumn and lay down
excess adipose tissue under the skin, over the muscles, and in the
abdominal cavity. Svihla and Svihla (<i>op. cit.</i>:133) noted that captives
from the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, gained weight in
September and October and became extremely fat. With the additional
weight they were more listless and drowsy, often spending
days curled up in the hibernating position with the head between
the hind legs and the long tail curled completely over the head and
body. Warmth aroused the animals to activity, but when the temperature
dropped they again hibernated. Flahaut (1939:17) reported
the discovery on February 23, 1939, at Henderson Inlet,
South Bay, Thurston County, Washington, of two nest cavities inhabited
by jumping mice that were hibernating. The nests, four
inches apart and 30 inches below the surface of the ground, were
approximately five inches in diameter and made of shredded paper.
Both mice were dormant, covered by nesting materials and curled
up in the aforementioned hibernating posture. Dalquest (1948:
371) writes that in the lowlands of Washington this species disappears
by late July but that in the mountains it remains active
until the middle of September. Edson (1932:56) records an individual
taken on April 20 from its place of hibernation beneath
the roots of a decaying stump. This animal quickly roused in the
warm mid-afternoon sun but became dormant again when the temperature
dropped to 45&#176; F. It seems that animals near the end of
hibernation become active on warm days and return to the torpid
state on cold ones.</p>

<p><i>Enemies.</i>&mdash;Little is recorded concerning enemies of <i>Z. trinotatus</i>,
but Bailey (1936:233) lists owls and other nocturnal birds, weasels,
skunks, and badgers as preying on this mouse. Smith and Hopkins
(1937:191) found <i>Z. t. orarius</i> in barn owl pellets obtained in Elk
Valley, Marin County, California.</p>

<p><i>Food.</i>&mdash;Bailey (<i>loc. cit.</i>) remarks that in Oregon, these mice feed
mainly on small seeds of grasses, small grains (wheat, barley, oats,
and rye), and other plants. These seeds are obtained by cutting
the stems, drawing the stems down and biting off lower sections
until the seed-laden heads are reached. Bailey (<i>op. cit.</i>:234) found
that <i>trinotatus</i> utilized also the seeds of the western skunk cabbage.</p>

<p>Near Seattle, Washington, according to Dalquest (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the
principal food of <i>Z. trinotatus</i> was velvet grass (<i>Holchus lanatus</i>),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
broad-leaved dock, and the seeds of other grasses. Dalquest reports
also that the fruit of the blackberry (<i>Rubus macropelatus</i>) is
eaten and that an occasional jumping mouse has its chin stained a
deep purple by juice from these berries.</p>

<p><i>Reproduction.</i>&mdash;There is normally a single litter of from four to
eight young per year according to Bailey (<i>loc. cit.</i>). Newly born
young have been described by Svihla and Svihla (1933:132) as
follows: slightly smaller than newly born harvest mice (<i>Reithrodontomys
m. megalotis</i>), average weight .8 grams, hairless (without
even vibrissae visible), pink, eyes closed, ears folded, heads
short and stubby, tails long (longer than those of newly born
<i>Peromyscus</i>), and bodies surprisingly small (when compared with
newly born <i>Peromyscus maniculatus</i>).</p>

<i>Z. t. trinotatus</i> in coloration (absence of ochraceous suffusion ventrally).
They are here referred to <i>Z. t. trinotatus</i>. The zone of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
Preble (1899:28), considered it to be a species, and others (Merriam,
1897a:104, Bailey, 1936:234) considered it to be a subspecies
of <i>Z. trinotatus</i>. <i>Z. montanus</i> is here considered to be a subspecies
of <i>Z. trinotatus</i>, because of the agreement of the two in size and
shape of the baculum, diameter and pigment pattern of the hair,
and the over-all proportions of the skull. In addition, animals from
intermediate geographic areas are available and show actual intergradation.</p>

<p>Intergradation has been noted in specimens from North Santiam

breadth of braincase, and in width of zygomata these specimens are
intermediate between <i>Zapus trinotatus montanus</i> and <i>Z. t. trinotatus</i>,
but in the sum-total of characters they are referable to the former.
Specimens from Lost Creek R. S., 10 mi. SE McKenzie Bridge, are

they are referable to <i>Z. t. montanus</i>. The animals available from
Brooks Meadow, 4300 ft., 9 mi. ENE Mt. Hood and the one from
Mt. Hood, in color, in length of incisive foramina, and in mastoid

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Preble (1899:30) named this jumping mouse as a full
species. Included in the specimens examined were animals from
Eureka and Mad River, Humboldt County, California. Howell
(1920:231) retained <i>Z. orarius</i> as a full species but restricted its
range to Marin County, California, and referred material from
northern California, including the animals from Eureka and Mad
River, to a new subspecies (<i>eureka</i>) of the species <i>Z. trinotatus</i>.
Howell (<i>loc. cit.</i>) suggested that <i>Z. orarius</i> had its closest affinity
with <i>Z. t. eureka</i> but remarked that intergrading material was not
available. Hooper (1944:68) arranged <i>Z. orarius</i> as a subspecies of
<i>Z. trinotatus</i> and suggested that intergrades could be expected from
geographically intermediate areas, for example, northern Sonoma
County, California.</p>

<p>Although animals from intermediate geographic areas still are not
available to show actual intergradation, I concur with Hooper
(<i>loc. cit.</i>) and arrange <i>Z. orarius</i> as a subspecies of <i>Z. trinotatus</i>.
The close relationship of <i>Z. orarius</i> to <i>Z. trinotatus</i> is evident; certain
diagnostic characters, held in common, are the shape and size
of the os penis, the diameter and pigment pattern of the hair, and
the general configuration of the skull.</p>

<p>Interbreeding in the wild between <i>Z. t. orarius</i> and <i>Z. t. eureka</i>
probably does not take place, because these subspecies are separated
by terrain unsuited to jumping mice.</p>

<div class="caption3 smcap">Geographic Variation</div>

<p>There are 11 subspecies recognized, most of which are in the
mountains of the western United States and southwestern Canada.
There is geographic variation in color, relative proportions of external
parts (tail, hind feet, head, and body), and shape and size of the
skull.</p>

<p>Three basic types of coloration occur in <i>Z. princeps</i>, as pointed
out by Hall (1931:9). Yellow-sided dark-backed jumping mice
exemplified by <i>kootenayensis</i>, <i>idahoensis</i>, and <i>utahensis</i> are found
to the eastward in the Rocky Mountains. Reddishbrown-sided,
brown-backed jumping mice typified by <i>luteus</i> and <i>pacificus</i> are
found to the westward in the Sierra Nevada and in New Mexico
and Arizona; mice with yellowish-buff or pinkish-buff-sides and light
backs are the subspecies, <i>cinereus</i>, <i>curtatus</i>, and <i>oregonus</i>, that
occur in the intervening Great Basin.</p>

<p>External dimension as a whole decreases from north to south,
although not uniformly. For example, the smallest individuals are
of the southernmost geographic subspecies (<i>Z. p. luteus</i>), but the
largest are of the subspecies (<i>Z. p. utahensis</i>) that is near the geographic
center of the range for the species. In the skull there is
geographic variation in the length and shape of the zygomata, size
and shape of the incisive foramina, alignment of maxillary tooth-rows,
size and shape of auditory bullae, position of the postpalatal
notch in relation to M3, and the presence or absence and size of the
medial projection on the inferior ramus of the zygomatic process
of the maxillary.</p>


<div class="caption3">NATURAL HISTORY</div>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&mdash;<i>Zapus princeps</i> occurs most commonly adjacent to
streams where grasses and herbs are in lush growth. It frequents
mountain meadows neighboring small streams and is often taken
from alder, aspen, or stands of willow, where the moist ground supports
a heavy undergrowth of herbs. Davis (1939:330) found these
mice in heavy herbage along a small stream bordered by quaking
aspen near Victor, Teton County, Idaho. They were found along
streams bordered by willow, rose, alder, huckleberry, sedges, and
herbs of various kinds at Alturas Lake, Mill Creek, and at the head of
the Pahsimeroi River. Linsdale (1938:195) found jumping mice
in the Toyabe Mountains, Nevada, near the streamsides or in seepy
areas close to the streams where associated vegetation included rose,
willow, wild peach, sage, grasses, and herbs. In the Uinta Mountains,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Utah, R. D. Svihla (1931:264) obtained them from willows
along streams in mountain parks. Borell and Ellis (1934:37) in
the Ruby Mountains, Nevada, found jumping mice to be common in
heavy vegetation along streams. Louise Kellogg (1916:369) obtained
jumping mice in northern California; all were near water, in
grassy meadows, or under alders where vegetation was dense.</p>

<p><i>Zapus princeps</i> is locally abundant, but its numbers seem to vary
considerably from year to year as well as seasonally. Early autumn,
when young of the year are abroad, seems to be the period of greatest
abundance. Moore (1928:154) remarks that runways were
plainly marked and well strewn with four-inch pieces of brome-grass.
Davis (1939:334) notes that <i>Z. princeps</i> has runways, and
found that sections, four inches long, of cut grass piled in runways
was good evidence of the presence of the mouse.</p>

<p><i>Behavior.</i>&mdash;In reference to locomotion of <i>Z. princeps</i>, Davis (<i>loc.
cit.</i>) writes, &ldquo;In rapid progression jumping mice move by a series
of zigzag hops. One young of the year found in tall grass near Victor
made horizontal leaps of approximately three feet. The zigzag
course was difficult for me to follow, and I was led to wonder if this
mode of locomotion were not advantageous to the mice in eluding
animals that would do them harm.&rdquo; Hollister (1912:26) remarked
that <i>princeps</i>, when startled, sometimes jumps five to six feet at a
bound. Concerning the swimming ability of <i>Z. princeps</i>, Bailey
(1936:233) quotes from Hollister&rsquo;s notes, &ldquo;While I was walking
around the grassy border of a small pond one jumped out at my feet
and struck in the water like a frog, which at first it was thought to
be, until it was seen swimming across the pond on the surface of the
water &#8230; he certainly handled himself as if perfectly at home
and swam with little effort and great speed over the still surface
of the pond.&rdquo; Davis (1939:334) obtained two individuals at Mill
Creek, Idaho, in traps placed on artificial islands of stones in the
middle of the creek where the water was about six inches deep. He
speculated that the only way the mice could have reached the traps
was by swimming. Grinnell, Dixon, and Linsdale (1930:531) record
an individual which was seen hopping in the inch-deep water
of a small stream at Lake Helen, California.</p>

<p>According to Hollister (1912:26) and Davis (1939:335), jumping
mice are for the most part nocturnal, but occasionally they are seen
by day in tall grass.</p>

<p>Little is recorded concerning the hibernation of <i>Z. princeps</i>.
What data are available suggest that, starting in July, these animals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
accumulate a heavy layer of fat on the inside of the skin with especially
large amounts in the inguinal region. By August or early
September, animals are excessively fat, and the start of hibernation
is dependent then upon the arrival of a heavy cold snap. Grinnell,
Dixon, and Linsdale (1930:531), in their study of the vertebrates
of the Lassen Peak region of California noted that the latest activity
by these mice was September 13. As regards the time of onset of
hibernation in Idaho, Davis (1939:336) states that, &ldquo;I know of no
records of capture later than September and infer that hibernation
begins in that month or the next.&rdquo; Bailey (1932:227) writes that in
New Mexico, animals obtained on September 20 were very fat,
probably were ready to hibernate at the first cold wave, and had
winter nests in burrows well underground.</p>

<p><i>Enemies.</i>&mdash;Bailey (<i>loc. cit.</i>) lists hawks, owls, and weasels as
natural predators on <i>Z. princeps</i>. Stanford (1931:362) records the
garter snake (<i>Thamnophis</i>) as a predator of jumping mice. A large
snake of this genus obtained by him regurgitated two jumping mice
a few hours after its capture. Grinnell, Dixon, and Linsdale (1937:232)
report that on Parker Creek, in California, H. C. Bryant
frightened a weasel that dropped a freshly killed jumping mouse.
Crowe (1943:407) reported <i>Cuterebra</i> fly larvae in the inguinal
region of a <i>Z. princeps</i> obtained at Invermere, British Columbia.
Several mice of this species taken at Moccasin Lake, 19 mi. W and 4
mi. N of Lander, 10,000 ft., Fremont County, Wyoming, were heavily
infested with mites of the family Laelaptidae.</p>

<p><i>Food.</i>&mdash;In early September in central Utah, Moore (1928:154)
found only a white, starchy, glutinous paste in stomachs of six
<i>Z. princeps</i> and only traces of a brown seed coat in a seventh. The
main seeds eaten seemed to be from an introduced brome-grass
which was abundant in the vicinity of capture. Bailey (1932:226)
wrote of <i>Z. princeps</i> in New Mexico, that &ldquo;In feeding they cut down
the tall grass, beginning at the bottom and cutting the stem at intervals
as high as they can reach until the seed part of the grass is
brought down.&rdquo; He (<i>op. cit.</i>:227) remarked that the food was
almost entirely seeds of grass and grasslike plants and that the
stomach contents almost always were perfectly clean white dough
from the shelled kernels of small seeds.</p>

<p><i>Reproduction.</i>&mdash;Females with embryos have been collected from
late May to mid-July and lactating individuals until late August.
Possibly there is only one litter per season as Davis (1939:336)
suggests is the case in Idaho.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>Embryos in 25 pregnant females averaged 5 (2-7). The mammae
of the female are arranged in four pairs (two abdominal, one pectoral,
and one inguinal).</p>

<p><i>Z. princeps</i> builds a grass nest on the ground which is placed
under cover of vegetation or surface litter. Bailey (1932:227) writes
that in New Mexico jumping mice of this species use fibers of grass
to construct a ball-shaped nest. The nest usually has one opening
but sometimes there are two. In the Ruby Mountains, of Nevada,
Borell and Ellis (1934:37) found the globular nests of this mouse
on the ground in tall grass.</p>

auditory bullae small; skull relatively long; zygomata relatively weak and not
widely bowed; nasals wide posteriorly; pterygoid fossae relatively narrow.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Zapus princeps nevadensis</i>, <i>Z. p. cinereus</i> differs as
follows: Size averaging smaller; entire coloration lighter; zygomata not so
widely bowed; incisive foramina not so wide posteriorly; auditory bullae smaller;
nasals wider posteriorly; pterygoid fossae narrower.</p>

<p>From <i>Zapus princeps idahoensis</i>, <i>Z. p. cinereus</i> can be distinguished by:
generally paler color; smaller auditory bullae; broader interorbital region;
anteriorly diverging tooth-rows; narrower pterygoid fossae.</p>

<p>For comparison with <i>Zapus princeps utahensis</i> see account of that subspecies.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Davis (1939:343) writes that &ldquo;since <i>cinereus</i> was described
from nine specimens, only two of which are near adult, one
cannot place much value on the coloration ascribed to it by Hall
(1931:7).&rdquo; I examined the type series and found, as did Davis
(<i>loc. cit.</i>), that the type is much lighter and grayer than is a near
adult paratype, which was obtained the same day; however, I do
not concur with Davis (<i>loc. cit.</i>) that specimens from Mt. Harrison,
10 mi. S Albion, Idaho, which are darker and much more ochraceous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
than the paratype, necessarily are more nearly typically colored.
These individuals, judged by cranial characters, are more nearly
typical of <i>cinereus</i> but show intergradation with <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> in
their darker and more ochraceous pelage.</p>

<p>Durrant (1952:387) found that the gray color of <i>Z. p. cinereus</i>
was not diagnostic in separating <i>Z. p. cinereus</i> from <i>Z. p. utahensis</i>,
because gray animals are also found in <i>Z. p. utahensis</i>. Specimens
from Camp Tendoy, Pocatello, Idaho, are intermediate in color and
in cranial characters as between <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> and <i>Z. p. cinereus</i>,
but here are referred to <i>Z. p. cinereus</i>. Whitlow and Hall (1933:268)
compared these individuals with specimens of <i>Z. p. princeps</i>
and <i>Z. p. cinereus</i>, finding them intermediate but in the aggregate of
several differential characters better referred to the latter.</p>

Warm Lake, 7000 ft., Valley County, Idaho; obtained on July 9, 1932, by
Robert T. Orr; original No. 660.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;From Banff, Alberta, southward through extreme southwestern
Alberta and extreme southwestern British Columbia, most of the panhandle of
Idaho, Kamiak Butte in eastern Washington, western Montana, and western
Wyoming (Green, Wind River and Absoroka ranges of the Rocky Mt&rsquo;s). See
<a href="#Fig_46">fig. 46</a>.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size, medium; back from near Clay Color to near Warm Buff,
usually overlaid with black hairs forming broad dorsal band; sides lighter than
back; lateral line indistinct or wanting; belly pure white, occasionally faintly
tinged with Ochraceous-Buff; tail indistinctly bicolored, tan to grayish-white
below and pale brown above; hind feet grayish-white above; ears dark, edged
with white or yellowish-white; postpalatal notch anterior to posterior border of
last molars; proximal part of inferior ramus of zygomatic process of maxillary
relatively narrow and usually without enlarged median projection; auditory
bullae well inflated; incisive foramina relatively narrow.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Zapus princeps kootenayensis</i>, <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> differs
as follows: Size averaging larger; upper parts with greater suffusion of ochraceous,
not grayish or dusty; skull larger; incisive foramina longer and relatively
wider; zygomatic breadth averaging greater; nasals broader at tips; auditory
bullae more inflated.</p>

<p>From <i>Zapus princeps oregonus</i>, <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> differs in: Size averaging
smaller; upper parts generally more suffused with black hairs, on the average
more yellowish with less ochraceous; skull smaller; incisive foramina narrower
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
(breadth less, instead of more, than 52 per cent of length); palatal bridge
shorter; zygomatic arch shorter; pterygoid fossae narrower.</p>

<p>From <i>Zapus princeps utahensis</i>, <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> can be distinguished by:
Size less; color slightly darker; skull averaging smaller in zygomatic breadth,
least interorbital constriction, and occipitonasal length; palate narrower; upper
tooth-rows nearly parallel as opposed to diverging anteriorly.</p>

<p>From <i>Zapus princeps minor</i>, <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> differs in: Size larger; color
of underparts less ochraceous; lateral line indistinct or wanting; skull averaging
larger in all measurements taken except that the two subspecies are approximately
same in least interorbital constriction, length of zygomatic arch, and
distance from anterior face of incisors to postpalatal notch; nasals, in profile,
straight instead of with proximal third depressed; postpalatal notch anterior to
posterior face of last molar, instead of even with, or usually posterior to, same.</p>

<p>From <i>Zapus princeps saltator</i>, <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> differs as follows: Size averaging
slightly larger; color darker, being less ochraceous and more yellow
dorsally and laterally; auditory bullae more inflated; zygomatic arches less
bowed laterally; incisive foramina narrower.</p>

<p>For comparison with <i>Zapus princeps princeps</i> and <i>Zapus princeps cinereus</i>
see accounts of those subspecies.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Intergradation occurs at almost all of the places where
the range of <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> is known to touch that of any other
geographic race. Nevertheless, each of the populations studied
has characters which make this subspecies recognizable as a taxonomic
unit, although its characters are not yet stabilized even in the
central part of its range.</p>

<p>Among named subspecies of <i>Zapus princeps</i>, <i>Zapus p. idahoensis</i>
most closely resembles <i>Zapus princeps kootenayensis</i>, its nearest geographic
neighbor to the north. Three specimens from 2 mi. NE
Weippe, 3000 ft., Idaho, are best referred to <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> but
show relationship to <i>Z. p. kootenayensis</i> in size and shape of the
tympanic bullae. The relationship of individuals from Idaho, here
referred to <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i>, from Glidden Lakes, Enaville, Cascade
Creek, and 13 mi. E and 5 mi. N Coeur d&rsquo;Alene, is discussed in the
account of <i>Z. p. kootenayensis</i>. British Columbian specimens from
Newgate and Crows Nest Pass, 4450 ft., as well as Albertan specimens
from Crows Nest Pass and various places in Waterton Lake
Park, resemble <i>Z. p. kootenayensis</i> in color but cranially are more
nearly like <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i>.</p>

<p>Intergradation with <i>Zapus princeps oregonus</i> was noted by Davis
(1939:340) in a specimen from Cedar Mountain in Idaho. I have
not seen this individual which he referred to <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> but
have seen a specimen from the N Fork of Potlatch River (15 mi. SE
Cedar Mt.), which, in color, closely resembles <i>Z. p. oregonus</i> but
cranially (shape of incisive foramina, size, and inflation of auditory
bullae) is more nearly like <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> to which it is referred.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
Davis (<i>loc. cit.</i>) indicates that specimens from summit of Smith
Mt., from 1 mi. N Bear Creek R. S., from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> mi. E Black Lake, and
from 3 mi. W Payette Lake, Idaho, are in an area of intergradation
between <i>Z. p. oregonus</i> and <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i>, but he referred them to
<i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> on the basis of cranial characters and length of hind
foot. Seven specimens from Alturas Lake, 7000 ft., Idaho, were
likewise so allocated by Davis (<i>loc. cit.</i>). I concur with him and in
addition refer the following intermediate individuals from Idaho to
<i>Z. p. idahoensis</i>: New Meadow, 1; Warren, 1; Perkins Lake, 7000 ft.,
Sawtooth Nat&rsquo;l Forest, 1; Prairie Creek, 12 mi. W Ketchum, 2400 ft.,
3. All are more nearly like <i>Z. p. oregonus</i> in color but cranially they
show more resemblance to <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i>.</p>

<p>In the eastern part of the range of <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i>, intergradation
occurs with <i>Zapus princeps minor</i>, as at 15 mi. S Heath, N Fork
Flat Willow Creek, Big Snowy Mt&rsquo;s, Montana. Specimens from
there have the lateral line enlarged and the maximum seen in this
species of Ochraceous color ventrally. The pterygoid fossae are
large and the bullae are reduced as in <i>Z. p. minor</i>, but in the sum
total of the characters the mice more closely resemble <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i>.
At Lewistown, 7 mi. NE Judith Mt&rsquo;s, Lime Kiln Gulch, Montana,
the animals are colored as are <i>Z. p. minor</i> but cranially are like
<i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> to which they are referred. Specimens from the
Highwood Mt&rsquo;s, Montana, also are intergrades; they have a relatively
distinct lateral line as in <i>Z. p. minor</i> but show no ventral suffusion
of Ochraceous; they have large bullae, nasals that are straight
in lateral profile and other cranial characters of <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> to
which they are here referred.</p>

<p>A single specimen from Kamiak Butte, Whitman County, Washington,
has been referred to <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> by Dalquest (1948:373).
I have not seen this individual, but, on geographic grounds, it is
likely to be of this subspecies.</p>

Rossland, West Kootenay district, British Columbia, at about, 6000 ft.; latitude
49&#176; 13&#8242; north, longitude 117&#176; 52&#8242; west; obtained on July 18, 1929, by R. M.
Anderson, original No. 24.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;From Glacier in the Selkirk Range, British Columbia, south to 5
mi. W Cocolalla, Bonner County, Idaho, west and north to Sullivan Lake, Pend
Oreille County, Washington; and northwestward to Manning Park on the
eastern summit of the Cascade Range in British Columbia. See <a href="#Fig_46">fig. 46</a>.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size, medium; color moderately dark; upper parts noticeably
dull and dusty; broad dorsal band of dull Ochraceous-Buff to near Warm Buff
sprinkled with black hair to a varying degree, resulting in two color phases
(dark has more black hair; Ochraceous phase or Warm Buff phase has more
brown hair); sides paler than back owing to fewer black hairs; lateral line,
when present, narrow and dull; ventral surface pure white; tail bicolored, pale
brown above, yellowish-white to dull white below; ears dark with narrow white
or yellowish-white edgings; feet white above; skull narrow across zygomata; incisive
foramina narrow; bullae moderately inflated; nasals narrow at tips; postpalatal
notch anterior to posterior face of last molars; braincase moderately narrow;
zygomatic arch short.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Zapus princeps saltator</i>, <i>Z. p. kootenayensis</i> differs as
follows: Upper parts generally dull with less ochraceous; sides with more
yellow, less ochraceous; lateral line wanting or not bright; skull averaging
slightly smaller; incisive foramina smaller and narrower posteriorly; small
medium projection on inferior ramus of the zygomatic process of maxillary
frequently present instead of absent; pterygoid fossae shorter and narrower.</p>

<p>For comparison with <i>Zapus princeps idahoensis</i> see account of that subspecies.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This subspecies is paler and averages smaller than
either of the subspecies with adjoining geographic ranges. There
is intergradation with <i>Zapus princeps idahoensis</i> in color, shape
and size of incisive foramina, and in the shape of the nasals in
Idaho-taken specimens from Glidden Lakes and Enaville. These
individuals are thought to be <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i>. Specimens from the
same state taken at Cascade Creek and 13 mi. E and 5 mi. N Coeur
d&rsquo;Alene show intergradation in color, size and inflation of bullae,
configuration of nasals, and shape of the vomer between <i>Zapus
princeps idahoensis</i> and <i>Z. p. kootenayensis</i>. The majority of characters
studied show these animals to be referable to <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i>.</p>

<p>Specimens from Monashee Pass, 4000 ft., British Columbia, show
relationship to <i>Zapus princeps saltator</i> in the posteriorly wide incisive
foramina, in the narrow vomer, and, in some individuals, in the
increased amount of ochraceous, dorsally and laterally. The majority
of characters studied show these animals to be referable to
<i>Z. p. kootenayensis</i>.</p>

<p>The animals available from Glacier, British Columbia, are in
color more nearly like <i>Z. p. saltator</i> and cranially combine the characters
of <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i>, <i>Z. p. saltator</i>, and <i>Z. p. kootenayensis</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
The sum total of their characters places them with <i>Z. p. saltator</i>.
Anderson (1932:108) remarks on the disparity of size between the
two sexes of <i>Z. p. kootenayensis</i>, stating that females are considerably
larger than males. I have examined most of the material used
in the original description and find that animals of like age in the
two sexes show no significant size difference. Anderson (<i>loc. cit.</i>)
seems to have compared young males with adult females.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;White Mt&rsquo;s of southern Apache County and northern Greenlee

Lower Sonoran (1 individual), Upper Sonoran, Transition, and Canadian.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size, small; back near Ochraceous-Buff, having black hair
interspersed; mid-dorsal band not always well marked; sides Ochraceous-Buff
with fine admixture of black hair; lateral line blending with Ochraceous-Buff
of sides, not distinct; ventral surface white to base of hairs, in some cases lightly
suffused with color of sides; tail indistinctly bicolored, tan to grayish-white
below and brown above; hind feet grayish-white above; ears brownish, narrowly
edged with Ochraceous-Buff; skull small; antorbital foramina relatively
large; interorbital region broad; inferior ramus of the zygomatic process of the
maxillary broad, often with medial projection; incisive foramina narrow posteriorly
becoming broadly rounded anteriorly; palatal bridge relatively long;
pterygoid fossae narrow; zygomatic arches relatively robust; nasals tapering at
each end.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Zapus princeps princeps</i>, <i>Z, p. luteus</i> differs as follows:
Size, smaller; color lighter, more Ochraceous-Buff; ears lighter, edged with
Ochraceous-Buff as compared with white or yellowish-white; lateral line indistinct
or wanting as opposed to distinct; dorsal stripe not well defined; interorbital
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
region broader; antorbital foramina relatively larger; zygomatic arches
more robust; nasals tapering at each end as opposed to parallel sided; auditory
bullae smaller, less inflated.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The characters of this subspecies are relatively stable
throughout most of its geographic range. Hall and Davis (1934:56)
remarked that their material from the White Mountains of Arizona
answered precisely to Miller&rsquo;s original description (1911:253) of
the species, and my examination of these and other specimens from
that area indicates the same thing except that the specimens average
slightly darker mid-dorsally than those from New Mexico.</p>

<p><i>Zapus luteus australis</i>, based on a single individual taken in a
riparian thicket along the Rio Grande at Socorro, New Mexico, is
referable to <i>Z. p. luteus</i>. The diagnostic characters, referred to in
the original description, are as follows: Small, slender, and very
narrow skull; especially narrow braincase; slender rostrum; and light
dentition. These are expressions of age, rather than of geographic
variation, in that the individual is a subadult (young of the year).
The color, which is paler than in adults of <i>Z. p. luteus</i>, is almost
identical with that of a subadult (No. 205585 USBS) from Alpine,
Arizona. I can see no basis for recognition of <i>Z. p. australis</i> and the
name, therefore, is placed as a synonym of <i>Z. p. luteus</i>.</p>

<p>Four specimens from 4 mi. NE El Rito, 7000 ft., New Mexico,
show intergradation, in the shape of the nasals and incisive foramina,
in the robustness of the zygomatic arch, and in the breadth
of the braincase with a specimen of <i>Zapus princeps princeps</i> from
Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico. In color and in external measurements

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Adult female, skin and skull, No. 73673, U. S. Nat. Mus. Biol. Surv.
Coll., Wingard, near Carlton House, Saskatchewan; obtained on July 23, 1895,
by J. Alden Loring, original No. 3123.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Most of southern half of Saskatchewan and Alberta, northeastern
Montana southeastward to Aweme, Manitoba, and Webster, South Dakota.
See <a href="#Fig_46">fig. 46</a>. Zonal range: Transition, Hudsonian, and Canadian.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size, small; back dark, usually with a distinct mid-dorsal band
of black mixed with Warm Buff; sides lighter, more yellowish, but always with
an admixture of black hairs; lateral line distinct, near Ochraceous-Buff, ventral
surface characteristically suffused with Ochraceous-Buff; tail bicolored, grayish-white
to yellowish-white below and pale brown above; hind feet grayish-white
above; ears dark, edged with white or yellowish-white; skull small; postpalatal
notch often anterior to posterior part of molars; inferior ramus of zygomatic
process of maxillary often with well developed medial projection; auditory
bullae flattened; nasals narrower anteriorly and proximal third depressed; base
of zygomatic process of squamosal broad.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Zapus princeps princeps</i>, <i>Z. p. minor</i> differs as follows:
Size averaging smaller in all measurements taken, except least interorbital constriction
which is approximately the same; color dorsally and laterally more
yellowish, less Ochraceous-Buff; ventrally greater suffusion of Ochraceous-Buff.</p>

<p>For comparison with <i>Zapus princeps idahoensis</i> see account of that subspecies.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This geographic race is notably stable and retains
most of its diagnostic characters throughout nearly all parts of its
range. Intergradation occurs with <i>Zapus princeps idahoensis</i> at
various localities in Montana, as is described in more detail in the
account of <i>idahoensis</i>. Crowe (1943:406) gives evidence of intergradation
between <i>Zapus princeps idahoensis</i> and <i>Z. p. minor</i> in
specimens from Entrance in western Alberta. Crowe (<i>loc. cit.</i>)
described these individuals as intermediate in color (lateral line
present, under parts washed with buff, sides and dorsal stripe rich
in ochraceous), and in cranial characters (smaller skulls, anteriorly
narrower nasals, shorter more deflected rostrum, and higher cranium);
but he considered them closer to <i>Z. p. minor</i>.</p>

<p>A skin without skull from Kananaskis Valley, Alberta, shows
intergradation between <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> and <i>Z. p. minor</i>. This
individual is like <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> in dorsal and lateral coloring, but
is nearer <i>Z. p. minor</i> in ventral coloring and in the presence of a
distinct lateral line. External measurements provide basis for tentatively
assigning the skin to <i>Z. p. minor</i>.</p>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Male, adult, skin and skull; No. 78156, U. S. Nat. Mus. Biol. Surv.
Coll.; Elgin, Blue Mountains, Union Co., Oregon; obtained on May 29, 1896,
by Edward A. Preble, original No. 959.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Southeastern Washington, eastern Oregon east of Cascades, northeastern
California, central and northeastern Nevada, and southwestern Idaho.
See <a href="#Fig_46">fig. 46</a>. Zonal range: Transition and Canadian.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size large; back from near Light Ochraceous-Buff to near
Cinnamon-Buff, usually overlaid with black hairs forming broad dorsal band,
which in some individuals is almost black; sides lighter than back, from near
Light Pinkish-Cinnamon to near Cinnamon-Buff and Ochraceous-Buff, often
with black hairs interspersed; lateral line faintly marked or wanting; belly pure
white; tail bicolored, grayish-brown above and grayish-white to yellowish-white
below; ears dark, edged with color of sides; palatal bridge long; interorbital
region broad; inferior ramus of zygomatic process of maxillary usually with
median projection; auditory bullae relatively small; incisive foramina greatly
enlarged posteriorly; tooth-rows divergent anteriorly; nasals narrow posteriorly.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Zapus princeps curtatus</i>, <i>Z. p. oregonus</i> differs as follows:
Size averaging larger; upper parts darker; tooth-rows more divergent
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>

wider posteriorly.</p>

<p>For comparisons with <i>Zapus princeps cinereus</i>, <i>Zapus princeps pacificus</i> and
<i>Zapus princeps idahoensis</i> see accounts of those subspecies.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The coloration in <i>Z. p. oregonus</i> varies somewhat from
north to south. In the northern part of the range the average coloration
of the upper parts is darker with more ochraceous on the sides.
To the southward the upper parts are progressively paler and the
sides are near Light Pinkish-Cinnamon. Because of this variation
of color, and because of the small samples available to workers in
the past, three populations of this subspecies have been named as
distinct. However, with the large amount of additional material
now available, the supposed diagnostic characters of these &ldquo;forms&rdquo;
prove to be within the range of individual variations of each of several
populations of which large samples are available.</p>

<p><i>Zapus major</i> Preble (1899:24) was described as having zygomata
short, palate broad and long, incisive foramina large and elliptical,
and color dark. Some specimens of <i>Z. p. oregonus</i>, from nearly all
parts of its geographic range, show these same characters. Resemblances
in anteriorly divergent tooth-rows, broad interorbital
region, small auditory bullae, and posteriorly narrow nasals, are
additional reasons for placing <i>Z. major</i> as a synonym of <i>Z. p. oregonus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Zapus nevadensis</i> Preble (1899:25), here considered a synonym
of <i>Z. p. oregonus</i>, was described as having: auditory bullae small,
posterior border of the palate usually convex anteriorly, palatal
bridge long, and color pale. These characters, however, are within
the range of individual variation of <i>Zapus p. oregonus</i>. Similarities
such as tooth-rows diverging anteriorly, nasals narrow posteriorly,
interorbital region broad, and incisive foramina enlarged posteriorly
are added reasons for placing <i>Z. nevadensis</i> as a synonym of <i>Z. p.
oregonus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Zapus princeps palatinus</i> Hall (1931:8) was described as having:
palatal bridge long, incisive foramina wide posteriorly, posterior
border of palate straight or convex posteriorly, and color pale.
These characteristics are to be found in some individuals in most
populations of <i>Z. p. oregonus</i>. Additional well marked cranial similarities,
such as small auditory bullae, broad interorbital region, and
nasals narrow posteriorly offer additional evidence as to the close
relationship of <i>Z. p. palatinus</i> and <i>Z. p. oregonus</i>. Hall (<i>loc. cit.</i>),
with a small sample available to him for comparative purposes (14
specimens of <i>Z. p. palatinus</i> and 12 specimens of <i>Z. p. nevadensis</i>),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
was impressed by the condition of the palate in <i>Z. p. palatinus</i> and
wrote: &ldquo;the generally straight, or even posteriorly convex, posterior
border of the palate seems to be unique among described
forms of <i>Zapus</i>. The name <i>palatinus</i> is given in allusion to this
structural feature.&rdquo; With more than 300 specimens of <i>Z. p. oregonus</i>
available for study I find that a straight or posteriorly convex posterior
border of the palate occurs in more than 50 per cent of the
individuals examined. Specimens displaying this described palatal
condition are known from all parts of the range of <i>Z. p. oregonus</i>,
but do occur in a higher percentage of specimens in the area ascribed
by Hall (<i>loc. cit.</i>) to the range of <i>Z. p. palatinus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Sierra Nevada Mt&rsquo;s, from Kern Peak, Tulare County, California,
northeastward to Mt. Rose, Washoe County, Nevada, then northwestward
through the Trinity and Salmon mountains, California, to the upper Rogue

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size medium; color bright; back near Ochraceous-Buff with
admixture of black hair forming dark dorsal band; sides bright Ochraceous-Buff
with fine admixture of black hair; lateral line blending with color of sides or
wanting or indistinct; ventral surface white; tail bicolored, grayish-brown

notch usually broadly rounded; auditory bullae relatively small and
flattened; nasals parallel sided; maxillary tooth-row short; interorbital region
moderately broad.</p>

<p><i>Comparison.</i>&mdash;From <i>Zapus princeps oregonus</i>, <i>Z. p. pacificus</i> differs in being
brighter in all pigmented areas; more ochraceous and less yellow laterally;
dorsally more ochraceous and less black; size averaging smaller; maxillary
tooth-rows shorter; auditory bullae less inflated and smaller; interorbital region
averaging narrower; palatal bridge averaging shorter; incisive foramina shorter
and posteriorly narrower; nasals parallel rather than narrowed posteriorly.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Original describers considered both <i>Z. pacificus</i> and
<i>Z. alleni</i> as specifically distinct from <i>Z. trinotatus</i>. Merriam (1897a:104)
named <i>Z. pacificus</i> and gave the following diagnostic characters:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
short rostrum and nasals; small auditory bullae; basioccipital
broad between bullae. Elliot (1898:212) named <i>Z. alleni</i> and ascribed
to it the following diagnostic characters: cranium long
and narrow; nasals same breadth for entire length; palate wide;
pterygoid fossae wide posteriorly; auditory bullae small; basisphenoid
and basioccipital wide; upper tooth-rows short. Preble
(1899:27) considered <i>Z. alleni</i> to be a subspecies of the species <i>Z.
trinotatus</i>, remarking that the skulls are similar to those of <i>Z.
trinotatus</i> but smaller with much smaller bullae; in coloration the
animals are lighter above and without fulvous below. Preble remarked
that the skull of <i>Z. alleni</i> differs so greatly from that of <i>Z.
montanus</i> that comparison was not required. Preble (<i>op. cit.</i>:30)
treated <i>Z. pacificus</i> as a full species. Howell (1920:233) considered
<i>Z. pacificus</i> and <i>Z. alleni</i> to be subspecies of <i>Z. pacificus</i>. Howell
(<i>loc. cit.</i>) pointed out size, cranial, and color similarities between
the two, and remarked that <i>pacificus</i> is clearly distinct from <i>Z. montanus</i>,
its nearest geographic neighbor. Hall (1946:578) arranged
<i>Z. alleni</i> as a subspecies of <i>Z. princeps</i>, although not on grounds
wholly satisfactory to him because actual intergrades between <i>alleni</i>
and neighboring races of <i>princeps</i> were not available.</p>

<p>I here consider <i>Z. alleni</i> to be synonymous with <i>Z. pacificus</i>; the
latter is a subspecies of <i>Z. princeps</i>. Certain diagnostic characters,
such as the shape and size of the os penis, the diameter and pigment
pattern of the hair, the over-all proportions of the skull, and the size
and shape of the teeth indicate that <i>alleni</i> and <i>princeps</i> belong to
the same species, even though animals from intermediate geographic
areas are not available to show actual intergradation.</p>

<p>The diagnostic characters referred to in the original description
of <i>Z. alleni</i>, as given earlier in this account, agree with characters of
specimens of <i>Z. p. pacificus</i>. Howell (1920:233) remarks that, in
coloration and length of foot, typical <i>alleni</i> differs but slightly from
<i>pacificus</i>. Howell (<i>loc. cit.</i>) noted, as I also have, that there are
slight cranial differences in specimens from various parts of the
range of <i>Z. p. pacificus</i>; these variations are somewhat clinal in
nature, cranial dimensions showing a slight increase from south to
north. The largest animals occur in western Tehama, Trinity, and

<p class="species"><i>Zapus princeps</i> J. A. Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:71-72, April 28,
1893; Preble, N. Amer. Fauna, 15:23, August 8, 1899.</p>

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Female, adult, skin and skull; No. 5260/4140, Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.;
Florida, La Plata County, Colorado; obtained on June 27, 1892, by Charles P.
Rowley.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Sierra Madre, Medicine Bow, Laramie, and Big Horn mountains of
Wyoming southward through Colorado into the Taos and San Juan mountains
in northern New Mexico. See <a href="#Fig_46">fig. 46</a>. Zonal range: Transition, Canadian and
Hudsonian.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size, medium; back dark usually with broad mid-dorsal band
of black mixed with Warm Buff or Ochraceous-Buff; sides light (Warm Buff)
but varying to Ochraceous-Buff, always with admixture of black hair; lateral
line distinct and broad, varying from Light Ochraceous-Buff to Ochraceous-Buff;
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
ventral surface white to base of hairs, frequently suffused with Ochraceous-Buff;
tail indistinctly bicolored, tan to grayish-white below and pale brown
above; hind feet grayish-white above; ears edged with white or yellowish-white;
skull medium; large medial projection on inferior ramus of zygomatic process
of maxillary; palate moderately long; postpalatal notch usually broadly rounded
and posterior to posterior part of last molar; proximal part of inferior ramus
of zygomatic process of maxillary broad; pterygoid fossae broad; auditory bullae
moderately inflated.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Zapus princeps luteus</i>, <i>Z. p. princeps</i> differs as follows:
Total length, tail and hind foot longer; color darker, being less ochraceous;
ears darker, edged with white or yellowish-white instead of Ochraceous-Buff;
lateral line more distinct; skull larger, except least interorbital breadth which
is smaller; auditory bullae larger, more inflated; pterygoid fossae larger; incisive
foramina broader, longer, and posteriorly more truncate; nasals broader, tapering
less distally.</p>

<p>From <i>Zapus princeps idahoensis</i>, <i>Z. p. princeps</i> differs in: Size larger; darker
with more Ochraceous-Buff; lateral line much more distinct; underparts frequently
suffused with Ochraceous-Buff rather than seldom so; skull larger as
regards length of palatal bridge, length of zygomatic arch, and width of proximal
part of inferior ramus of zygomatic process of maxillary; pterygoid fossae
broader; medial projection on inferior ramus of zygomatic process of maxillary
large instead of reduced or absent; postpalatal notch usually anterior to, or
on a plane with, posterior face of last molars rather than posterior to same.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This subspecies retains most of its diagnostic characters
in all parts of its geographic range. An individual from the
type locality, Florida, Colorado, resembles <i>Zapus princeps luteus</i>
in color, but cranially is most nearly like <i>Z. p. princeps</i>. A specimen
from Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico, a locality 25 miles north of, and
in homogeneous habitat with, El Rito, New Mexico, from which
specimens of <i>Z. p. luteus</i> are known, shows resemblance to the
latter in some cranial characters (see account of <i>Zapus princeps
luteus</i>) but is most nearly like <i>Z. p. princeps</i> to which it is referred.</p>

<p>Animals from Medicine Wheel Ranch, 9000 ft., 28 mi. E Lovell,
Wyoming, which are here referred to <i>Z. p. princeps</i>, show intergradation
with <i>Zapus princeps idahoensis</i>, being similar in size of
pterygoid fossae, breadth of postpalatal notch, and in size and degree
of inflation of the auditory bullae, but differ in color and in
other cranial characters. Specimens from 2 mi. E Shriver, 6500 ft.,
Montana, which lack the distinct lateral line and ventral suffusion of
Ochraceous-Buff, are here referred to <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Female, subadult, skin and skull, No. 14408, Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.;
Telegraph Creek, British Columbia; obtained on August 23, 1897, by A. J. Stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Southern Yukon and southeastern Alaska south in British Columbia,
to Bella Coola Inlet and Glacier. See <a href="#Fig_46">fig. 46</a>. Zonal range: Canadian and
Hudsonian.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size medium; back near Ochraceous-Buff, overlaid with black
hairs forming dark dorsal band thickly flecked with ochraceous; sides lighter
than back; lateral line usually distinct; belly pure white, sometimes faintly
suffused with Ochraceous-Buff; tail bicolored, dark above and grayish-white
below; hind feet grayish-white above; ears dark, edged with yellowish-white
or Ochraceous-Buff; incisive foramina long, broad posteriorly; palatal bridge
relatively short; postpalatal notch anterior to posterior border of last molars;
proximal part of inferior ramus of zygomatic process of maxillary without
enlarged median projection; zygomatic arch short.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;For comparison with <i>Zapus princeps kootenayensis</i> and
<i>Zapus princeps idahoensis</i> see accounts of those subspecies.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The geographic range of <i>Z. p. saltator</i>, as here understood,
includes several localities heretofore considered to be within
the geographic ranges of neighboring subspecies. Specimens from
Indianpoint Lake, 15 mi. N of Barkerville, British Columbia, for
example, which Hall (1934:379) considered nearer <i>Z. p. princeps</i>,
are here referred to <i>Z. p. saltator</i>, with which they closely agree in
cranial measurements and color of pelage. One individual from
Glacier, British Columbia, thought to be <i>Z. p. princeps</i> by Preble
(1899:32), is here considered to show intergradation between <i>Z. p.
kootenayensis</i> and <i>Z. p. saltator</i> but is more nearly like <i>Z. p. saltator</i>
to which it is here referred. Intergradation between <i>Zapus princeps
idahoensis</i> and <i>Z. p. saltator</i> is noted, in color and in shape and size
of the incisive foramina, in a specimen from Vermilion Crossing,
Kootenay, British Columbia. The majority of cranial characters
show these animals to be referable to <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i>. Specimens
from Mt. Revelstoke, 3400 ft., British Columbia, show intergradation
in shape of auditory bullae, in breadth of pterygoid fossae, and in
shape and size of antorbital foramina between <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> and
<i>Z. p. saltator</i>. Resemblance in pelage and in the majority of cranial
characters indicates that these specimens are best referred to <i>Z. p.
saltator</i>.</p>

of Utah. See <a href="#Fig_46">fig. 46</a>. Zonal range: Transition, Canadian, and Hudsonian.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size, large; back from Cinnamon-Buff to Warm Buff overlaid
with black hairs; sides lighter with less admixture of black hairs; lateral line
indistinct, sometimes wanting; tail bicolored, brownish-black above, white to
yellowish-white beneath; feet grayish-white above; ventral surface white to base
of hairs; ears dark, edged with white to yellowish-white; skull large; palatal
bridge relatively short; upper tooth-rows diverging anteriorly; occipitonasal
length great; interorbital region broad; zygomata widely bowed; postpalatal
notch anterior to posterior face of last molars; mastoid width great.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Zapus princeps princeps</i>, <i>Z. p. utahensis</i> differs in:
color dorsally and laterally less ochraceous, lacking broad lateral line; skull
larger in every part measured, excepting length of palatal bridge and breadth
of palate at M3; zygomata more bowed; upper tooth-rows more divergent
anteriorly; postpalatal notch anterior to posterior border of last molars.</p>

<p>Compared with <i>Zapus princeps cinereus</i>, <i>Z. p. utahensis</i> differs as follows:
Size averaging larger; upper parts darker, Cinnamon-Buff not Pinkish-Buff;
incisive foramina wider posteriorly; palate wider; zygomata more robust.</p>

<p>For comparison with <i>Zapus princeps idahoensis</i> see account of that subspecies.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Zapus princeps utahensis</i> most closely resembles the
several subspecies in the Great Basin in its large size, widely bowed
zygomata, and posteriorly broadened incisive foramina. Intergradation
between <i>Z. p. utahensis</i> and <i>Zapus princeps cinereus</i>,
geographically the nearest of the Great Basin subspecies, is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
known. Intergradation in color and cranial characters occurs between
<i>Zapus princeps idahoensis</i> and <i>Z. p. utahensis</i> in specimens
from 17 mi. E and 4 mi. N of Ashton, Idaho. All these specimens
are, however, referable to <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i>. Animals from 9 mi. SE
Irwin and from 3 mi. SW Victor, Idaho, resemble <i>Z. p. utahensis</i> in
most differential characters (dorsally ochraceous, lateral line more
distinct, incisive foramina large, palate broad anteriorly, auditory
bullae less inflated), and are here referred to <i>Z. p. utahensis</i>. A
series of specimens from the head of Crow Creek, Idaho, were considered
by Davis (1939:340) to be intergrades between <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i>
and <i>Z. p. utahensis</i>; he thought that the specimens were more
nearly like <i>Z. p. utahensis</i> in color, but cranially (80 per cent in
average ratio of anterior width of palate to posterior width of palate),
more nearly like <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i>, to which subspecies he referred
them. I have examined these specimens and find them to be
more nearly like <i>Z. p. utahensis</i> not only in color but in cranial
characters as well. For example, the average ratio obtained by me
for anterior width of palate to posterior width of palate is 72 per
cent, rather than 80 per cent as given by Davis (<i>loc. cit.</i>). Other
cranial characters, size of the incisive foramina, shape of the foramen
magnum, and shape of the auditory bullae, indicate relationship
with <i>Z. p. utahensis</i> to which they are here referred. Two immature
individuals from Strawberry Creek, 20 mi. E Preston, Idaho,
considered to be <i>Z. p. idahoensis</i> by Davis (<i>op. cit.</i>:341), also are
here referred to <i>Z. p. utahensis</i>.</p>

</div>


<div class="caption3 smcap">Geographic Variation</div>

<p>The species <i>Z. hudsonius</i> is divisible into 11 subspecies based on
differences in color, relative proportions of the tail, hind feet, body,
and size and shape of parts of the skull (zygomata, braincase,
incisive foramina, auditory bullae, pterygoid fossae, rostrum, and
interorbital breadth).</p>

<p>Color of the pelage varies, as a general rule, from dark-backed,
dull-sided individuals in the northern parts of the geographic range
of the species to light-backed, bright-sided individuals in the southern
parts of the range.</p>

<p>Individuals from the southernmost geographic races (<i>Z. h. americanus</i>
and <i>Z. h. pallidus</i>) are the smallest for the species and those
from the northernmost subspecies (<i>Z. h. alascensis</i>) are the largest.
One subspecies, <i>Z. h. campestris</i>, from the central part of the range
of the species, however, seems to be out of the cline. This form
inhabits the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains and is a
robust animal approaching <i>Z. princeps</i> in size.</p>

<p>Seemingly there is no clinal variation in the several qualitative
features of the cranium, for instance in the shape of the auditory
bullae, shape of the incisive foramina, and shape of the postpalatal
notch. On the other hand, the dimensions of the entire skull show
that the larger crania are of the northernmost subspecies and the
smaller of the southernmost subspecies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption3">NATURAL HISTORY</div>

<p><i>Habitat.</i>&mdash;<i>Zapus hudsonius</i> occurs in low undergrowth usually
of grasses or forbs or both, in open coniferous forests, deciduous
hardwood groves, or in stands of tall shrubs and low trees, but most
frequently in open, moist areas.</p>

<p>Quimby (1951:75) notes that jumping mice were more common
in the moist lowlands than in the drier uplands. More were in the
open type lowlands than in the forested type, and these mice
favored habitats normally bordered by small streams affording
moist to semi-aquatic living conditions. The reports of Goodwin
(1924:255), Christian (1936:416), G. S. Miller (1899:329),
Cory (1912:249), Lyon (1936:277), Stoner (1918:123), and others,
although concerning widely different parts of North America, indicate
that <i>Z. hudsonius</i> selects habitats in vegetation of like form,
even though different assemblages of plant species may be involved.</p>

<p>An average of 11.91 mice per acre was recorded by Quimby
(1951:91) from a study plot at Itasca Park, Clearwater County,
Minnesota. He gives the monthly population densities per acre for
<i>Z. hudsonius</i> at Centerville, Anoka County, Minnesota, as follows:
June 2.78, July 3.57, August 3.10, and September 1.81. Blair&rsquo;s
(1940:248) data on bi-monthly population density per acre for <i>Z.
hudsonius</i> on the Edwin S. George Reserve, Livingston County,
Michigan, are remarkably similar, when adjusted on a monthly
basis, to those obtained by Quimby (<i>loc. cit.</i>). Blair&rsquo;s (<i>loc. cit.</i>)
monthly population densities per acre are as follows: June 3.90,
July 3.85, August 3.10, and September 2.00. Townsend (1935:90)
estimated population densities per acre for <i>Z. hudsonius</i> in central
New York state, at 11 to 72 individuals. As Quimby (1951:92)
points out, Townsend&rsquo;s figures are probably too high, as commonly
is the case when the moving quadrat technique is used because
animals from neighboring areas enter the trapped area to take over
the niches made available by their predecessors&rsquo; removal.</p>

<p>The population of <i>Z. hudsonius</i> may vary considerably from year
to year as well as seasonally. Blair (1940:249) found notably fewer
jumping mice on the George Reserve in 1938 than in 1939. Quimby
(1951:94) found the numbers of <i>Zapus</i> to be highly variable and
thought that there was a rapid turnover. Young animals were not
caught until July when 25 per cent were either juveniles, young,
or subadults; from this time on these age classes increased to a
high of sixty-one per cent in September. Quimby (<i>loc. cit.</i>) found
that separating the individuals into their proper age classes was more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
difficult in September, since the young from early litters are adultlike
in appearance. His data indicate as he remarked, &ldquo;That the
over-wintering adults are, for the most part, gradually replaced by
the young of the year as the summer progresses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sexes in <i>Z. hudsonius</i> vary only slightly from a one to one
ratio. Quimby (1951:63) found a sex ratio of 110 females to 100
males and Blair (1940:245) records a sex ratio of 113 males to 100
females. Townsend (1935:42) records a sex ratio in central New
York of 155 males to 100 females. Such a wide variation from a
one to one ratio suggest that the moving quadrat technique, which
Townsend (1935:90) employed in obtaining his data, may be, in
some way unknown to me, more selective for the males.</p>

<p><i>Behavior.</i>&mdash;The saltatorial powers of <i>Z. hudsonius</i> are well developed
and often have been described in the literature. Stoner
(1918:123) remarks that, &ldquo;When disturbed <i>hudsonius</i> moves away
by a series of leaps &#8230; the distance traversed in one of these
leaps is from six to eight feet.&rdquo;; Cory (1912:249) observed these
mice to make surprisingly long leaps, and, according to him, a distance
of 10 feet is by no means unusual; Handley and Patton (1947:49)
credit these animals with jumping eight to ten feet at a single
bound; Hamilton (1935:190) remarked that he noted an average of
not more than four to six feet per jump; Townsend (1935:91) observed
one individual make jumps of about two feet; and Harper
(1932:29) records a jumping mouse leaping for distances of two to
three feet. Quimby (1951:72) notes that he had never seen one
jump farther than three feet. He found that the greatest jumps occurred
initially and normally covered a distance of two to three
feet; subsequent leaps were shorter but more rapid. A jumping
mouse in full retreat progressed by jumps of about one foot.</p>

<p>Statements concerning the gait of <i>Z. hudsonius</i> are not in agreement
but the consensus of opinion is that these animals when unfrightened
progress by a series of hops of one to six inches, or, occasionally,
with a slow creeping motion while the animal is on all
fours. When frightened, however, their progress is by long bounds;
the mice make a series of two or three such leaps to the nearest
protective cover, and then sit motionless until pursued.</p>

<p>Concerning the use of the tail as a balancing organ, G. S. Miller
(1899:330) describes the behavior of a jumping mouse from which
the tail had been severed by the sickle of a mowing machine.
"When I approached, it made violent efforts to escape, but the
moment it was launched in the air, its body, deprived of its balancing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
power, turned end over end so that it was as likely as not to strike
the ground facing the direction from which it had come."</p>

<p>Riparian animals such as <i>Z. hudsonius</i> need enter the water to
escape from enemies or perhaps in search of food. <i>Zapus hudsonius</i>
can and does swim. Hamilton (1935:190) found it to be a strong
swimmer capable of remaining in the water for from four to five
minutes. According to Hamilton (<i>loc. cit.</i>), when the mouse is
swimming the head is held high, the tail is arched near its middle,
and only the hind limbs are employed in propulsion. According
to Sheldon (1938:327), Philip Allan, in northern Minnesota, saw
many <i>Z. hudsonius</i> swimming three or four inches under the surface
of the water. The mice swam upstream and only the hind legs
were employed in the swimming movements. N. A. Preble (1944:200),
at Archer&rsquo;s Pond, 3 miles southeast of Center, Ossipee County,
New Hampshire, observed a jumping mouse swimming rapidly
under water toward another portion of the shore 30 or 40 feet away.
The mouse, swimming less than a foot beneath the surface, was
vigorously using both forefeet and hind feet, but the long tail trailing
limply behind, contributed in no way to the animal&rsquo;s movements.
Quimby (1951:72) released five of the mice, one at a time, in the
open water of a lake. He followed alongside in a boat and observed
that, &ldquo;In all instances the animals proved to be excellent swimmers
both on and underneath the surface. The methods of progression
were similar to land movements; i. e., the limbs were employed differently
at various times depending upon the speed. When first
placed in water they moved rapidly by lunges produced by sweeping
strokes of the hind limbs employed simultaneously. This movement
was accomplished similarly to the long jumps made on land &#8230;
Following the first excited lunges, they settled down to a
steadier and slower gait using all four limbs one at a time. The
anterior part of the body was held high in the water &#8230; When
approached too closely, they attempted to escape by diving. The
maximum distance noted was about four feet &#8230; One was
able to swim vigorously for approximately three minutes after which
it tired greatly and was in danger of drowning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As concerns digging ability, Goodwin (1935:148) reports that
<i>Z. hudsonius</i> makes its own burrows; these are short and close to
the surface in the summer but longer, deeper, and below the frost-line
in winter. Two captives used their forefeet and nails in digging
a tunnel in the foot of soil that Goodwin (<i>loc. cit.</i>) had placed in
their cage. Quimby (1951:72) remarks that captives excavate soil
by means of the front feet and throw the soil out behind; as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
burrow deepened the hind feet were also utilized to throw the loose
soil out of the burrow.</p>

<p><i>Zapus hudsonius</i> climbs; Sheldon (1934:293) observed captive animals
to climb over small evergreen trees in their cages. They moved
with surprising sureness and agility, chasing each other among the
branches or sitting for several minutes at a time on one of the limbs.
Hamilton (1935:190) found that the mice ran over limbs and brush
which were placed in their outdoor enclosure.</p>

<p>Ordinarily <i>Z. hudsonius</i> is nocturnal, appearing in the early dusk
and remaining active until pre-dawn. Occasional individuals are
abroad in daylight hours. Sheldon (1934:293) found in Nova
Scotia that <i>Z. hudsonius</i> is most active from early dusk through the
night, but that it may be abroad in daylight as well. Her statements
are based on trapping results, field observations, and observations
made on captive individuals. Quimby (1951:73) found that <i>Z. hudsonius</i>
in Michigan is mostly nocturnal; however, he saw mice on a
few occasions in the daytime. Diurnal activity seems to be increased
in cloudy or damp weather; Quimby (<i>loc. cit.</i>) almost invariably
trapped more of these mice on cloudy, damp days than on
other days.</p>

<p>This jumping mouse usually is silent but does utter various sounds.
Sheldon (1934:295) records squeaking and clucking noises. Quimby
(1951:73) records the clucking noise described by Sheldon (<i>loc.
cit.</i>) and mentions also the squeaking and suckling sounds produced
by the small young. This mouse is most vociferous when young
or when about to go into hibernation. Sheldon (1938:327) writes
that <i>Z. hudsonius</i> makes a drumming noise by vibrating the tail
against dry leaves.</p>

<p>Many data are available concerning the hibernation of <i>Z. hudsonius</i>.
In general it seems necessary for the mice to put on a certain
amount of fat preparatory to hibernation. This fat is deposited
in a thin layer over the inside of the skin, over the back, and in the
body cavities. The thickest deposits are in and about the inguinal
region.</p>

<p>Quimby (1951:83) noted that gain in weight was accelerated in
a brief period prior to entrance into hibernation. This relationship
of rapid gain in weight to hibernation allows a person to estimate
the date of hibernation. Cold weather seems to hasten hibernation,
but less so than the correct physiologic condition which is
foreshadowed by a rapid gain in weight. For example, Quimby&rsquo;s
(1951:84) data reveal that mice that were moved to a heated room
gained weight and hibernated in a fashion similar to those in unheated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
surroundings. Hamilton (1935:193) states that, &ldquo;It seems
necessary for the mouse to lay on a certain amount of fat before it
is capable of hibernation.&rdquo; Hamilton (<i>loc. cit.</i>) reported that 18
specimens of <i>Z. hudsonius</i> taken [presumably in an active state]
near Ithaca, New York, on November 13, were without a trace of fat.</p>

<p>Data that are available concerning the hibernation sites of <i>Z. hudsonius</i>
show that almost invariably these mice seek shelter in burrows
beneath the surface of the ground and there construct nests
of grass, leaves, or some other vegetation. Nicholson (1937:103)
found a hibernating <i>Z. hudsonius</i> on the George Reserve, Livingston
County, Michigan, on October 20. The mouse was in a nest, composed
of 10 to 12 damp elm leaves, in a sand bank two feet three
inches vertically and three feet nine inches horizontally from the
surface. On April 11, 1948, Schwartz (1951:228) found five nests
(three with occupants) of <i>Z. hudsonius</i> at Jefferson City, Cole
County, Missouri. All nests were one foot beneath the surface of a
pile of coal-ash, which was about three and one-half feet high and
five feet in diameter. The nests were spherical, approximately four
inches in diameter and consisted of dried oak leaves and bits of
dried grass. Grizzell (1949:74) found two hibernating jumping
mice at the Patuxent Research Refuge, Laurel, Maryland, in January,
1948. The mice were in separate woodchuck dens; one mouse
was 40 inches below the surface and the other was 26 inches below
the surface. The mice were curled up in the center of masses of dead
leaves, and thus, were well insulated against the cold. On April 29,
1944, at Ithaca, New York, Eadie (1949:307) uncovered a hibernating
jumping mouse. The nest, about the size of a baseball, was
compactly made of fine grasses and was 10 inches below the surface
of the ground in a mound of earth that was approximately six by
four feet at the base and three feet high.</p>

<p>From the foregoing reports on hibernation sites it is evident that
well drained areas are utilized. Sheldon (1934:300) remarks that
the burrows used for hibernating are dug in a bank or some place
from which the rain water and melted snow probably drains off.</p>

<p>Eadie (1949:307), Grizzell (1949:75), Sheldon (1934:299),
Schwartz (1951:228), and Sheldon (1938:331) all agree that the
hibernating mouse rolls up into a ball-like shape (resting on its head
and pelvis) with the head between the hind legs, the nose against
the lower belly, the forefeet curled on the chest, and the tail curled
around the head and body.</p>

<p>A marked loss of weight occurs immediately after hibernation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
begins, and then reduction in weight is slow and regular. (See
Hamilton, 1935:194 and Quimby, 1951:84.)</p>

<p>Sheldon (1934:297) cites a letter from Vernon Bailey in which he
remarks on the necessity of abundant moisture and saturate air for
hibernating jumping mice. Bailey writes &ldquo;&#8230; they will
awaken at times famished for water and will drink and drink before
going back to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hamilton (1935:195) thinks that in the Ithaca area of New York
these mice probably leave their winter quarters in the second half
of April and that in southern New York and Long Island they emerge
considerably earlier. Quimby (1951:82) and Bernard Bailey (1929:163)
report that males appear earlier in the spring than do the females.
Quimby (<i>loc. cit.</i>), by recording the sequence and dates of
phenological events and appearance of <i>Zapus</i> in several years, was
able to predict fairly accurately the time of emergence of <i>Zapus</i>
in a succeeding year. In Minnesota, jumping mice emerged late
compared to other hibernating rodents.</p>

<p><i>Enemies.</i>&mdash;V. Bailey (1927:119) reports that A. K. Fisher found
50 skulls of <i>Zapus</i> in barn owl pellets taken from the towers of the
Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C. Dearborn (1932:32)
reported mink as having fed on jumping mice. Surface (1906:197)
records taking a <i>Zapus</i> from the stomach of a rattlesnake. Pearson
and Pearson (1947:138) found remains of <i>Z. hudsonius</i> in pellets
of barn owls. Quimby (1951:74) reports two cases of predation on
<i>Z. hudsonius</i>; one was by a northern pike, <i>Esox lucius</i> Linnaeus and
the other was by a weasel, <i>Mustela</i> sp. Vergeer (1948:91) collected
a green frog, <i>Rana clamitans</i> Latreille, which had eaten a jumping
mouse.</p>

<p>Quimby (1951:74) frequently found the fleas, <i>Megabothris
quirini</i> Rothschild, and <i>Megabothris wagneri</i> (Baker), and occasionally
a larval tick, <i>Dermocenter variabilis</i> (Say), on <i>Z. hudsonius</i>.
Sheldon (1934:296) remarks that captive animals are burdened
with numerous fleas. Hamilton (1935:191) removed a louse from
a jumping mouse. One mouse had a hole in the throat and three
others had holes in the inguinal region; presumably bot-flies had
emerged from these holes. Test (1943:507) found a single <i>Cuterebra</i>
larva in the inguinal region of a <i>Z. hudsonius</i>, and Sheldon
(1938:328) found <i>Z. hudsonius</i> infested by larvae of <i>Cuterebra
fontinella</i> Clark. Here, as in other cases, these larvae were found
immediately below the skin. Erickson (1938:252) examined 18
<i>Z. hudsonius</i> obtained in Minnesota, and found that three were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
parasitized. He found a bot-fly larva, <i>Cuterebra</i> sp., nematodes of
the genera <i>Subulura</i> and <i>Spirocerca</i>, and a fluke of the genus
<i>Notocotylus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Food.</i>&mdash;Quimby (1951:85-86) studied the food preferences, by
presenting to caged <i>Z. hudsonius</i> the plants and invertebrate animals
normally available to these mice in nature, and indicates that
in general, the starchy fruits of the Gramineae and the less fleshy
fruits of various groups of plants are more heavily utilized than
other plant materials. His observations indicate that these rodents
are highly insectivorous and that they consume many insects under
natural conditions. Goodwin (1935:148) reports that the stomach
contents of several individuals obtained at South Woodstock, Connecticut,
consisted exclusively of blackberries, and that others had
subsisted principally on cranberries. Hamilton (1935:197) remarks
that seeds are the favored food but that berries, nuts, fruits of various
kinds, roots, and insects are also utilized. Stoner (1918:123)
writes that the food in cultivated areas of Iowa is various grains
as well as grass and weed seeds; in wooded places the mice feed
on seeds and nuts of trees. Vernon Bailey (1927:118) states that
the examination of a great many stomachs of these jumping mice
[in North Dakota] revealed nothing &ldquo;but the fine white pulp of
carefully shelled, well-masticated seeds. Generally these are from
grasses, although grain and a variety of other plant seeds are eaten.&rdquo;
Schmidt (1931:116) examined the stomach contents of several
<i>Z. hudsonius</i> taken in Clark County, Wisconsin, and in most stomachs
found the remains of finely chewed roots; however, two from
Hewett had eaten several geometrid caterpillars.</p>

<p>Lyon (1938:279), Stoner (1918:123), and J. W. Bailey (1946:263)
present information which indicates that <i>Z. hudsonius</i> stores
food in its nests or burrows. Possibly these mice awaken at intervals
from hibernation and eat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These rodents characteristically seize the material to be eaten
with the front feet and devour it while reclining on their haunches.
The following observation of a caged animal is typical of their feeding
habits. The mouse selected a head of yellow foxtail, <i>Setaria
glauca</i> (Weig.) Stuntz, from several in the cage, separated it by
gnawing through the supporting stem, seized it with the front feet,
held it up to the mouth and began to gnaw at one end, stripping
all parts from the rachis. The grass head was slowly rotated and
shifted sideways until nothing remained but the rachis which was
discarded. Actually the seeds were the only parts eaten &#8230;&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
(Quimby, 1951:73). Sheldon (1934:294) remarks that <i>Z. hudsonius</i>
eats from a squatting position and holds the piece of food in the
forepaws. The mouse seems to bite off a seed, and then, holding it
in the forepaws, transfers it to the mouth.</p>

<p>According to Sheldon (<i>op. cit.</i>:295) and Quimby (<i>loc. cit.</i>), caged
jumping mice drink water. When drinking, the mouths of the mice
are in contact with the water, but neither observer determined
whether the mice lapped or sucked the water. Sheldon (<i>loc. cit.</i>)
observed these mice passing stems of long grass through their
mouths as though to squeeze out moisture, and thought that the
mice obtain most of their required moisture from green plants.</p>

<p><i>Reproduction.</i>&mdash;The breeding season begins shortly after the jumping
mice emerge from hibernation in the spring, and reproduction
continues until a few weeks before they hibernate in the autumn.
The extent of the breeding period probably varies geographically
and possibly seasonally. For example, Quimby&rsquo;s (<i>op. cit.</i>:70) information
suggests that the 1947 period of parturition occurred between
June 15 and August 30 in the area of Centerville, Minnesota.
In Michigan, Blair (1940:246) found a peak of breeding activity
in spring and another in late summer with little activity in the intervening
midsummer. Brimley (1923:263) records a female in North
Carolina, with eight embryos on June 13, 1895, and another with
seven embryos on September 17, 1891, indicating a strong possibility
of two litters per year there. Vernon Bailey (1927:118)
records young born in May or June in North Dakota and thinks
that there is time for only one litter per year. Petrides (1948:76)
captured a female on September 22, 1944, at Athens, Georgia, that
gave birth to six young on September 29. This late parturition date
indicates a longer breeding season in the southeastern part of the
range of <i>Z. hudsonius</i>.</p>

<p>The gestation period of nonlactating, caged <i>Z. hudsonius</i>, Quimby
(1951:63) thinks, &ldquo;is approximately 18 days &#8230; [but] gestation
is prolonged in lactating females.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Data from museum labels indicate that embryos in 62 pregnant
females averaged 5.4 (2-8) per female. Quimby (1951:67) found
the average number of embryos per female for 14 females taken in
Minnesota, to be 5.3 and that litters of young found in nests averaged
5.8. Sheldon (1938:330) reports two litters of seven young
each and one of four young for <i>Z. hudsonius</i> in Vermont. Petrides
(1948:76) records a litter of six young for <i>Z. hudsonius</i> in Georgia.
Brimley (1923:263) records one lot of seven and one lot of eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
embryos for <i>Z. hudsonius</i> in North Carolina. Vernon Bailey (1923:120)
reports six embryos for a female of <i>Z. hudsonius</i> taken in
Washington, D. C. Ivor (1934:8) obtained a litter of five young
<i>Z. hudsonius</i> from Erindale, Peel County, Ontario. Hamilton (1935:195)
records litters of two, four, and five young and embryo counts
of four, two, four, and four for <i>Z. hudsonius</i> in New York.</p>

<p>There seems to be two litters per year. According to Quimby
(1951:69), &ldquo;most adult females breed soon after emergence from
hibernation and produce the first litters within a month. The remaining
females do not breed immediately but produce the first
litter,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;in the second month after emergence.&rdquo; Both early-breeding
females and late-breeding females produce at least 2
litters per year. Those that breed early may have 3 litters.</p>

<p>The appearance and development of growing young of <i>Z. hudsonius</i>
in successive weeks is described by Quimby (1951:65).
Newborn young are pink and hairless except for microscopic vibrissae.
The eyes and external auditory meatus are closed, and the
pinnae are folded. The toes are fleshy and clawless; the tail is short
in relation to the length of the body. The average weight was .78
grams. The average measurements of three from different litters
are: total length, 34 mm; tail, 9.2 mm; hind foot, 4.7 mm. The
young are helpless but capable of emitting a high pitched squeaking
sound which is audible for several feet.</p>

<p>In the first week of growth the vibrissae become visible to the
naked eye, the body changes to flesh color, the dorsal parts become
dark gray, the pinna unfolds and is black tipped, and the claws
appear. The young now are able to crawl and make a suckling
noise, but they are not yet able to support themselves on their legs.</p>

<p>In the second week of development, tawny yellow hair appears
on the back and spreads onto the sides. Sparse hair of a lighter
color appears on the belly, backs of the feet, and outer surfaces of
the legs. Vibrissae are now prominent. The eyes are still closed,
but a crack down the center of each is visible by the 13th day.
Claws have grown, the longest measuring 1.5 mm. The incisors
erupt on approximately the 13th day, those in the lower jaw appearing
slightly before those in the upper jaw, and all are white. Activity
is increased; nevertheless the young still crawl, make suckling
notes, and squeak.</p>

<p>In the third week of development the mice are covered with
hair; darker hair appears dorsally; and vibrissae continue rapid
growth. The external auditory meatus begins to open on about the
19th day and young react to sound on the 20th. The incisors now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
are 1 mm long and the claws 1.5 mm long. Young are able to support
themselves on their legs, walk, and make one inch hops.</p>

<p>In the fourth week the juvenal pelage is replaced by adult pelage.
The eyes open between the 22nd and 25th days. The color of the
incisors changes from white to yellowish-orange as in the adults.
P<sup>4</sup>, M<sup>1</sup>, M<sup>2</sup>, m1 and m2 have emerged from the maxillary and dentary
bones; M<sup>3</sup> and m3 have not yet erupted. A mouse 33 days old
had all teeth well developed. By the end of the 4th week the young,
except for size, are adultlike and capable of independent existence.</p>

<p>The greatest increase in dimensions of the body is in the first
four weeks. A slowing down of growth is simultaneous with weaning.</p>

<p>Other workers, Sheldon (1938:330), Petrides (1948:76), and Ivor
(1934:8) also describe the appearance of the young.</p>

<p>Summer nesting sites are usually on the surface of the ground.
Jumping mice characteristically construct a globular nest of grass
but will utilize other vegetation if grasses are not available. Nests
are usually concealed under rocks, logs, bushes, or grass and can be
entered by a hole at one side.</p>

<p>Sheldon (1938:328) described a nest of <i>Z. hudsonius</i> found on the
ground near the edge of a small hay field. The nest was globular, not
more than four inches in outside diameter and two inches in inside
diameter; it was closely woven of fine, dry grass and bits of moss.
Another nest found in the same field measured 11.5 inches in circumference
at the base and six inches in circumference over the top.
The inside width and length each was three inches, and the inside
height was 3.5 inches. Vernon Bailey (1927:118) remarks that summer
nests are placed on the surface of the ground well concealed
under grass or other vegetation. He describes the nest as &ldquo;neat
little balls of fine grass with a tiny opening at one side and a soft
lining in the central chamber.&rdquo; Cory (1912:249) reports that summer
nests are concealed behind rocks or under bushes and thick
grass. The nests are round and four or five inches in diameter with
an entrance hole at one side. Goodwin (1935:148) examined a
nest made entirely of straight, narrow leaves of grass. Ivor (1934:8)
found one made of finely shredded jute sacking. Quimby (1951:80)
describes several nests: one in the center of a rotten willow log
was lined with small pieces of pulpy wood; another was in the rotted
wood and debris, at ground level, inside a large, red oak (this
globular nest composed of grasses, plant fibers, and rootlets measured
six inches in diameter). Another nest was composed of a pile of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
wood pulp, leaves of oaks, and grasses; this nest was in a hollow
root detached from a willow tree.</p>

<p>The mean home range of males, of <i>Z. hudsonius</i> in Minnesota, according
to Quimby (1951:86), was 2.70 plus or minus .50 acres;
this was significantly larger than the mean home range of females,
1.57 plus or minus .27 acres. According to Quimby (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the
size and shape of the home range is influenced by the general features
of the terrain, density and type of cover, and land use in
the immediate area. Quimby (1951:94) remarked that the home
range of the jumping mouse is relatively unstable and Blair (1940:247)
stated that the home ranges of both sexes generally overlapped
the ranges of other members of the same species and sex. The
average size of the home range for <i>Z. hudsonius</i> in Michigan was
.89 plus or minus .11 acres for males and .92 plus or minus .11
acres for females.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size medium; back from near Ochraceous-Tawny to near

distinct against color of sides; sides lighter than back and from near Cinnamon-Buff

<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
faintly marked but sometimes distinct and clear Warm-Buff; underparts white,
sometimes suffused with color of sides; tail distinctly bicolored, brownish-black
above and yellowish-white to grayish-white below; ears dark, edged with color
of sides; feet grayish-white above; pterygoid fossae relatively narrow; zygomata
relatively long and broad; auditory bullae relatively narrow, usually with

sides and flanks being more ochraceous and less yellowish; zygomata relatively
longer; pterygoid fossae relatively narrower; auditory bullae relatively narrower
and usually with depression on anterior surface.</p>

<p>From <i>Zapus hudsonius americanus</i>, <i>Z. h. acadicus</i> differs as follows: Size
larger; color darker on upper parts, flanks duller (less ochraceous); underparts
white, much less frequently suffused with color of sides; ears dark,
usually without flecks of ochraceous; general appearance of pelage not so
brightly colored; zygomata longer; condylobasal length greater; mastoid region
relatively broader; bullae larger, more inflated and usually with depression on
anterior surface; maxillary tooth-row relatively longer.</p>

<p>For comparison with <i>Zapus hudsonius ladas</i> see account of that subspecies.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Specimens from various localities in Nova Scotia,
Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick are essentially similar.
Anderson (1942:38) revived the name <i>Z. h. acadicus</i> for jumping
mice from these areas, correctly considering them to be distinct
from <i>Z. h. canadensis</i>, the geographic race immediately to the west.</p>

<p>In the size and shape of the auditory bullae, length of the zygomata,
breadth of the pterygoid fossae, and general color of the
pelage the populations from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are
essentially indistinguishable from material of <i>Zapus hudsonius hardyi</i>
from Maine. Thus, <i>Z. h. hardyi</i> must fall as a synonym of the earlier
proposed name <i>Z. h. acadicus</i>.</p>

<p>Bole and Moulthrop (1942:165) applied the name <i>Z. h. hardyi</i>
(= <i>acadicus</i>) to the mice inhabiting a large area from coastal Maine
and central New Hampshire through southern New England, New
York, northwestern Pennsylvania, and northeastern Ohio. I agree
with Bole and Moulthrop (<i>loc. cit.</i>) that the population of <i>Zapus
hudsonius</i> from Maine, New Hampshire, west-central and northern
New England are different from neighboring subspecies and are
referable to <i>Z. h. acadicus</i>, but find that material from extreme
southern Massachusetts, Connecticut, southern New York, northwestern
Pennsylvania, and northeastern Ohio is best referred to
<i>Zapus hudsonius americanus</i> (see account of that subspecies).</p>

<p>Intergradation between <i>Z. h. americanus</i> and <i>Z. h. acadicus</i> is
indicated by specimens from Berlin, Rensselaer County, New York.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
In color of ears, length of zygomata, and size and shape of the incisive
foramina these specimens are more nearly like <i>Z. h. americanus</i>
but in size and shape of the auditory bullae, breadth of the mastoid
region, and general appearance of the pelage they are more nearly
like <i>Z. h. acadicus</i> and are here referred to <i>acadicus</i>. Specimens
from Glenville, Schenectady County, New York, are intermediate
in cranial characters between <i>Z. h. americanus</i> and <i>Z. h. acadicus</i>
but in color are best referred to the latter. Specimens from 1 mi. S
Ayer, Worchester County, Massachusetts, are like <i>Z. h. americanus</i>
in their short zygomata, narrow mastoid region and suffusion of
the underparts; nevertheless, in the shape of the auditory bullae,
breadth of the pterygoid fossae, and greater condylobasal length
the specimens are more nearly like <i>Z. h. acadicus</i> which they are
here considered to be. Animals from Essex and Wilmington, Essex
County, Massachusetts, are like <i>Z. h. americanus</i> in external size
and in the size and shape of the auditory bullae; but they are more
nearly like <i>Z. h. acadicus</i> in most cranial characters and in the general
color of the pelage and are here assigned to <i>Z. h. acadicus</i>.</p>

<p>Specimens from Keene Valley, Essex County, New York, considered
by Batchelder (1899:4) to be <i>Z. h. canadensis</i>, are in color,
length of the zygomata, and size and shape of the auditory bullae
more nearly like <i>Z. h. acadicus</i> to which subspecies they are here
assigned. A specimen from Orwell, Addison County, Vermont,
that Batchelder (<i>op. cit.</i>:5) referred to <i>Z. h. canadensis</i> is more
nearly like <i>Z. h. acadicus</i> in the shape of the auditory bullae, length
of the zygomata, and color of the pelage, and is here referred to
<i>Z. h. acadicus</i>. Specimens from western New Brunswick, referred
to <i>Z. h. canadensis</i> by Anderson (1942:37), are more nearly like
<i>Z. h. acadicus</i>. Specimens from Ste. Anne des Monts, Gasp&#233; Peninsula,
Quebec, are intermediate between <i>Z. h. canadensis</i> and <i>Z. h.
acadicus</i> in color and size and also in the shape of the auditory bullae
but are best referred to <i>Z. h. acadicus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Zapus hudsonius acadicus</i> as here understood is a relatively wide-ranging
subspecies. Populations at the southern periphery of its
range are difficult to separate from populations at the northern
periphery of the range of <i>Z. h. americanus</i>. These two geographic
races represent opposite extremes of a clinal gradient and, as would
be expected, geographic intermediates are morphologically similar.</p>

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Male, adult, skin and skull, No. 73584, U. S. Nat. Mus., Biol. Surv.
Coll.; Yakutat Bay, Alaska; obtained on July 5, 1895, by Clark P. Streator,
original No. 4660.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Alaska Peninsula, coastal section of mainland of southern and
southeastern Alaska including Revillagigedo Island; also southwestern Yukon.
See <a href="#Fig_47">fig. 47</a>. Zonal range: Canadian and Hudsonian.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size large; back from near Ochraceous-Tawny to near Dresden
Brown, sometimes darkened with black tipped hair usually with darker mid-dorsal
area forming a band; sides lighter than back and from near Ochraceous-Tawny
to near Clay Color; lateral line usually distinct, of clear Ochraceous-Buff;
belly white, frequently with a slight suffusion of Ochraceous-Buff; tail
bicolored, brownish to brownish-black above, white to yellowish-white below;
ears dark, edged and flecked on the inner surface with color of sides; feet grayish-white

above; auditory bullae broad and moderately inflated; pterygoid
fossae relatively broad; incisive foramina relatively long, zygomata relatively
long and broadly bowed; mastoid region relatively broad; distance from incisors
to postpalatal notch relatively great; occipitonasal length relatively great.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Zapus hudsonius tenellus</i>, <i>Z. h. alascensis</i> differs as
follows: Size larger; upper parts darker, less ochraceous; sides duller, less
ochraceous more tawny; incisive foramina averaging longer; mastoid region
broader; occipitonasal length greater; zygomata wider-spreading and longer;
condylobasal length averaging greater; auditory bullae less broadly rounded;
and distance from incisors to postpalatal notch averaging greater.</p>

<p>For comparison with <i>Zapus hudsonius hudsonius</i> see account of that subspecies.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Zapus hudsonius alascensis</i> is a fairly well marked
subspecies retaining most of its characters throughout its range.
Variation is noted in specimens from the southwest end of Dezadeash
Lake, 2400 ft., Yukon Territory, and seems to be the result of
intergradation between <i>Zapus hudsonius hudsonius</i> and <i>Z. h. alascensis</i>.
These animals are like <i>Z. h. hudsonius</i> in the shape of the
auditory bullae but are otherwise more nearly like <i>Z. h. alascensis</i>
to which they are here assigned. Alaskan specimens from 7 mi.
SSE Haines, and from a point 9 mi. W and 4 mi. N Haines average
slightly larger than <i>Z. h. alascensis</i> in most measurements taken;
however, in coloration they more nearly agree with <i>Z. h. alascensis</i>
than with <i>Z. h. hudsonius</i> or <i>Z. h. tenellus</i> the geographic ranges of
which adjoin that of <i>Z. h. alascensis</i>.</p>

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;No type specimen designated. <i>Dipus americanus</i> was characterized
from jumping mice obtained by Barton near the Schuylkill River, a few miles
from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Southeastern United States and lower peninsula of Michigan; east
of central Indiana; from central New York and Massachusetts southward to
northern Georgia. See <a href="#Fig_47">fig. 47</a>. Zonal range: Austroriparian (Lower Austral),
Carolinian (Upper Austral), Alleghanian (Transition), and Canadian.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size small; back from near Light Ochraceous-Buff to near
Ochraceous-Buff with admixture of black-tipped hair forming distinct dorsal
band; sides bright, lighter than back from near Light Ochraceous-Buff to near
Ochraceous-Buff; lateral line usually distinct and of color of sides; underparts
white, sometimes with slight suffusion of color of sides; tail bicolored, brown
to brownish-black above, yellowish-white to grayish-white below; ears narrowly
edged and heavily flecked with color of sides; feet white to grayish-white
above; skull short; braincase relatively narrow; incisive foramina relatively
broad; skull relatively narrow across zygomata; interorbital region relatively
broad; distance from incisors to postpalatal notch relatively short; auditory
bullae relatively small.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;Compared with <i>Zapus hudsonius canadensis</i>, <i>Z. h. americanus</i>
differs as follows: Smaller; paler (in a sense brighter because more
ochraceous and less tawny); skull smaller; auditory bullae narrower, less inflated;
incisive foramina relatively more bowed; condylobasal length averaging
less.</p>

<p>From <i>Zapus hudsonius intermedius</i>, <i>Z. h. americanus</i> differs as follows:
Smaller; color brighter, more ochraceous, less yellow; braincase relatively narrower;
auditory bullae usually smaller; incisive foramina broader; inferior ramus
of zygomatic process of maxillary usually with median projection; interorbital
region averaging broader.</p>

<p>For comparison with <i>Zapus hudsonius acadicus</i> see account of that subspecies.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Intergradation with <i>Zapus hudsonius acadicus</i> occurs
in southeastern New York as indicated by a series of 25 specimens
from Peterboro. They resemble <i>Z. h. acadicus</i> in width of the mastoid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
region and relatively longer tooth-row, but in the size and
shape of the auditory bullae, width of the pterygoid fossae, and
lighter, brighter, color of the sides they are more nearly like <i>Z. h.
americanus</i> to which they are here referred.</p>

<p>Intergradation between <i>Z. h. americanus</i> and <i>Z. h. acadicus</i> is
indicated also by specimens from Lawyersville and Schoharie, New
York. In animals from both localities the length of the zygomata
and the breadth of the mastoid region are more nearly as in <i>Z. h.
acadicus</i>, but in size and shape of the auditory bullae, over-all
length of the skull, color of the ears, and general color of the pelage
they are more nearly like <i>Z. h. americanus</i> to which they are here
referred.</p>

<p>Specimens from western Pennsylvania, judged to be <i>Z. h. hudsonius</i>
by Preble (1899:17), and those from northwestern Pennsylvania
and northeastern Ohio, allocated to <i>Z. h. hardyi</i> (= <i>acadicus</i>)
by Bole and Moulthrop (1942:165), are more nearly like <i>Z. h.
americanus</i> in size and shape of the auditory bullae, short zygomata,
relatively narrow mastoid region, and color of pelage.</p>

<p>Specimens from the lower peninsula of Michigan, northeastern
Indiana, and northwestern Ohio, described by Bole and Moulthrop
(<i>op. cit.</i>:168) as belonging to a new subspecies (<i>Zapus hudsonius
brevipes</i>), are to me indistinguishable from most specimens of
<i>Z. h. americanus</i>. The characters which Bole and Moulthrop (<i>loc.
cit.</i>) ascribe to <i>Z. h. brevipes</i>&mdash;color bright Ochraceous-Buff, tail
and hind feet short, and skull narrow&mdash;are also those of <i>Z. h. americanus</i>.</p>

<p>Specimens from various localities in southeastern Ohio, all within
the range ascribed by Bole and Moulthrop (<i>op. cit.</i>:169) to <i>Zapus
hudsonius rafinesquei</i>, are indistinguishable from specimens of <i>Z. h.
americanus</i> from eastern Tennessee, West Virginia, North Carolina,
and Maryland. <i>Zapus hudsonius rafinesquei</i> (at least that part
from southeastern Ohio) is indistinguishable from <i>Z. h. americanus</i>
and therefore is synonymized under <i>Z. h. americanus</i>.</p>

<p>Specimens from Lagrange County, Indiana, show intergradation
between <i>Zapus hudsonius intermedius</i> and <i>Z. h. americanus</i> in the
color of the pelage but are more nearly like <i>Z. h. americanus</i> to
which they are here referred. One from Porter County, Indiana,
is more nearly like <i>Z. h. intermedius</i> in size and shape of the bullae
and in breadth of the pterygoid fossae but in color and degree of
lateral bowing of the zygomata is better placed with <i>Z. h. americanus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Z. h. americanus</i> is a wide ranging subspecies. Animals at the
northern periphery of the range (lower peninsula of Michigan to
the west and southeastern Massachusetts to the east) are largest
and darkest; to the southward there is a progressive reduction in
size and a change to a lighter, brighter color. Animals from Maryland,
Virginia, and North Carolina are more nearly average representatives
of the subspecies than are those from the region of the
type locality.</p>

<p>A jumping mouse allegedly of this subspecies has been recorded
by Coleman (1941:91) from Caesars Head, 300 ft., South Carolina.
This specimen and one from Athens, Georgia, provide the southeasternmost
record-stations of occurrence for the species <i>Z. hudsonius</i>.</p>

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;No type specimen designated, subspecies characterized on the basis
of two specimens obtained by Major General Thomas Davies within a few
miles of the city of Quebec.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Eastern Ontario and western Quebec from Hudson Bay southward
to the Great Lakes and into northwestern New York. See <a href="#Fig_47">fig. 47</a>. Zonal range:
Transition and Canadian.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size medium; back from near Clay Color to near Cinnamon-Buff
with admixture of black hair usually forming a dorsal band; sides from
near Clay Color to near Cinnamon-Buff and lighter than back; lateral line
usually distinct, and clear Cinnamon-Buff; belly white, sometimes with slight

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Zapus hudsonius hudsonius</i>, <i>Z. h. canadensis</i> differs
as follows: Upper parts generally dull averaging lighter, less black tipped

</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Bole and Moulthrop (1942:165) refer 2 specimens
from Elba, New York, to <i>Z. h. hardyi</i> (= <i>acadicus</i>); they are more
nearly like <i>Z. h. canadensis</i> in size and shape of the auditory bullae
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
and general color of the pelage. A specimen from Spectacle Pond,
New York, has the narrow pterygoid fossae and relatively narrow
auditory bullae of <i>Z. h. acadicus</i> and the relatively short, narrow
incisive foramina, inflated frontal region, and color of <i>Z. h. canadensis</i>
to which the specimen is here referred. Intergradation is
noted also in animals from Schreiber, Ontario. They resemble
<i>Zapus hudsonius hudsonius</i> in their darker coloration and shape of
auditory bullae but in the remainder of the characters studied resemble
<i>Z. h. canadensis</i> to which they are referred. Specimens
from Notre Dame de la Dore and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> mi. N Mistassini Post, Quebec,
in size and shape of the auditory bullae and in width of the pterygoid
fossae, closely approach <i>Z. h. ladas</i> but in color, distinct dorsal
band, and in narrower zygomata are all nearest <i>Z. h. canadensis</i> to
which subspecies they are here referred.</p>

<p><i>Zapus hudsonius ontarioensis</i> Anderson (1942:59) from eastern
Ontario was based chiefly, in comparison with <i>Z. h. canadensis</i>,
upon, &ldquo;dorsal stripe less distinct and sides somewhat duller yellowish
with more admixture of blackish hairs.&rdquo; Examination of 68 of the
69 specimens from the type locality shows that 58 are subadult and
in subadult pelage. Individuals which are adult are indistinguishable
in color of pelage and in cranial features from comparable material
from southern Quebec. <i>Z. h. ontarioensis</i> is, therefore, considered
to be a synonym of <i>Z. h. canadensis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Preble (1899:16) had available for study five specimens
of <i>Zapus hudsonius hudsonius</i> from Hudson Bay. Four were
preserved in alcohol and one as an incomplete skin (prepared from
an alcoholic specimen). All were unreliable for comparative purposes
owing to the effects of the preservative. Preble, therefore,
(<i>loc. cit.</i>) selected as a fairly typical sample a series of specimens
from Tower, St. Louis County, Minnesota; these formed the basis of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
comparison between <i>Z. h. hudsonius</i> and other subspecies of <i>Zapus
hudsonius</i>. Now that additional material (well prepared skins and
skulls) is available from the Hudson Bay region and from other
localities in northern and western Canada it is evident that the
specimens from Tower, although here considered to be <i>Z. h. hudsonius</i>,
are not typical <i>Z. h. hudsonius</i> but are intergrades between
<i>hudsonius</i> and specimens of <i>Zapus hudsonius intermedius</i>. Comparisons
made in the present account are based on specimens from
the vicinity of Hudson Bay (Fort Severen, Ontario, York Factory,
Shamatawa River, and Robinson Portage, Manitoba). These individuals
are considered typical of this subspecies. With these new
data available the range of <i>Z. h. hudsonius</i> is now understood to include
all of the region from eastern Alaska to the northern parts of
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.</p>

<p>Intergradation between <i>Zapus hudsonius canadensis</i> and <i>Z. h.
hudsonius</i> is noted in specimens from 30 mi. NE Port Arthur and
also in those from Silver Islet, Thunder Cape, Ontario. These individuals
resemble <i>Z. h. canadensis</i> in size and shape of the auditory
bullae and in the shape of the nasals, but in their darker coloration,
broadly rounded incisive foramina, and relatively narrow pterygoid
fossae they are more nearly like <i>Z. h. hudsonius</i> to which they are
here referred.</p>

<p>Specimens from Minaki, Ontario, are tending toward <i>Zapus
hudsonius intermedius</i> in lighter coloration but in the size and shape
of the auditory bulla, size and shape of the incisive foramina, and
in the width of the pterygoid fossae they are more nearly like <i>Z. h.
hudsonius</i> to which they are here referred. Specimens from various
localities in Menominee County, Michigan, are like <i>Z. h. intermedius</i>
in shape of the incisive foramina and shape of the postpalatal notch,
but in color of pelage, size and shape of the auditory bullae, and
breadth of the pterygoid fossae they closely resemble <i>Z. h. hudsonius</i>.</p>

<p>In Wisconsin, intergradation occurs in color and in cranial characters
in specimens from Mercer, Solon Spring, and in a single
individual from Basswood Lake. All these specimens, however,
are best referable to <i>Z. h. hudsonius</i>.</p>

<p>Specimens from one mile southwest of Fairbanks and from
Fairbanks, Alaska, show intergradation with <i>Zapus hudsonius alascensis</i>
in coloration (more brown, less black), but in small size,
short, broadly rounded incisive foramina, and in size and shape of
the auditory bullae are nearest to <i>Z. h. hudsonius</i> to which they are
here assigned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<p>Intergradation with <i>Zapus hudsonius alascensis</i> is noted also in
specimens from McIntyre Creek, Yukon. They are like <i>Z. h. alascensis</i>
in the size and shape of the auditory bullae and in the more
elongate incisive foramina, but in the coloration, size of the pterygoid
fossae, and breadth of the braincase are more nearly like <i>Z. h. hudsonius</i>
and are here referred to this geographic race.</p>

<p>In British Columbia, in specimens from 1 mi. NW junction of Irons
Creek and Laird River as well as in those from Hot Springs, 3 mi.
WNW junction of Trout River and Laird River, and in those from
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> mi. S of the junction of the same rivers, three way intergradation
occurs. These animals are like <i>Zapus hudsonius alascensis</i> in color
and in length of tail. They agree with <i>Zapus hudsonius tenellus</i>
in shape of nasals. In degree of inflation of auditory bullae, in
length and width of incisive foramina, and in shape of pterygoid
fossae they are as in <i>Z. h. hudsonius</i> to which they are here assigned.</p>

No. 517.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Eastern Montana, North Dakota, probably northern South Dakota,
all but northern parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, southwestern
Indiana, and western Kentucky. See <a href="#Fig_47">fig. 47</a>. Zonal range: Upper Austral
(Upper Sonoran and Carolinian) and Transition (Alleghanian and Transition).</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size medium; back from near Warm Buff to near Ochraceous-Buff
with admixture of hair tipped with black or dark brown usually forming
distinct, broad, dorsal band; sides lighter, from near Warm Buff to near Ochraceous-Buff
with sparse mixture of dark-tipped hairs; lateral line often poorly
marked but when present of clear Ochraceous-Buff; belly white, sometimes
with slight suffusion of color of sides; tail bicolored, grayish-brown to brownish-black
above, white to grayish-white or yellowish-white below; ears dark, narrowly
edged with color of sides; feet white to grayish-white above; tail relatively
short; lateral margins of nasals parallel; auditory bullae relatively short, broadly
rounded, and moderately inflated; incisive foramina relatively long and narrow;
pterygoid fossae relatively narrow; zygomata relatively long; inferior ramus of
zygomatic process of maxillary frequently lacking a median projection.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;From <i>Zapus hudsonius pallidus</i>, <i>Z. h. intermedius</i> differs as
follows: Coloration duller, not so bright, more yellow or buff and less bright
Ochraceous-Buff; interorbital region averaging narrower; incisive foramina averaging
longer and narrower; condylobasal length averaging greater; braincase
averaging broader; mastoid region averaging broader.</p>

<p>For comparisons with <i>Zapus hudsonius hudsonius</i>, <i>Zapus hudsonius campestris</i>,
and <i>Zapus hudsonius americanus</i> see accounts of those subspecies.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Zapus hudsonius intermedius</i> has a large geographic
range. There is some variation detectable when individuals from
widely separate localities are compared, but where there is much
variation it is obviously the result of intergradation. All characters
differentiating <i>Z. h. intermedius</i> from any contiguous subspecies are
not present in every specimen even in the type series. Nevertheless,
a certain series of cranial characters (narrow incisive foramina,
short rounded auditory bullae, parallel lateral margins of nasals and
narrow pterygoid fossae) is diagnostic.</p>

<p>Animals obtained from extreme southwestern Indiana and from
eastern Illinois approach <i>Z. h. americanus</i> in color and in shape of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
the incisive foramina, but in the shape of the nasals, width of the
pterygoid fossae and breadth of the zygomata are most nearly like
<i>Z. h. intermedius</i> to which they are here referred. Specimens from
Lake and Kane counties, Illinois, also show affinity with <i>Z. h. americanus</i>
in color, but cranially are most nearly like <i>Z. h. intermedius</i>
and are assigned to that subspecies.</p>

<p>Two specimens from southern Illinois (Perry County) are intergrades
between <i>Z. h. pallidus</i> and <i>Z. h. intermedius</i>. Cockrum and
Baker (1950:3) mentioned that these individuals showed evidence
of intergradation with <i>Z. h. pallidus</i> in color of the pelage and the
breadth of the least interorbital constriction. In other characters
the specimens are most nearly like <i>Z. h. intermedius</i> to which they
are here referred. Animals from Lyon County, Iowa, also show
intergradation between <i>Z. h. pallidus</i> and <i>Z. h. intermedius</i>. These
individuals are most nearly like <i>Z. h. pallidus</i> in interorbital breadth
of the skull but in other characters agree with <i>Z. h. intermedius</i>
and, therefore, are referred to that subspecies.</p>

<p>Intergradation between <i>Z. h. campestris</i> and <i>Z. h. intermedius</i> is
noted in a specimen from 7 mi. NE Glendive, Montana. This individual
has the larger, broader, auditory bullae and more widely
bowed incisive foramina of <i>Z. h. campestris</i>, but in color, in smaller
external size, and in the majority of cranial characters it is best referred
to <i>Z. h. intermedius</i>.</p>

<p>Specimens from the north-central periphery of the geographic
range of <i>Z. h. intermedius</i> (northern Minnesota and Wisconsin) on
the average are darker, have longer auditory bullae, wider bowed
incisive foramina, and (some specimens) a slightly wider pterygoid
fossa than is normal in more southern populations. This deviation
from the norm is interpreted as intergradation between <i>Z. h. hudsonius</i>
and <i>Z. h. intermedius</i>. Individuals from Burnett, Price, and
Oconto counties, Wisconsin, and those from Cass and southern
Clearwater counties, Minnesota, show such intergradation but are
here considered to be <i>Z. h. intermedius</i>.</p>

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Female, adult, skin and skull, No. 4169, E. A. and O. Bangs Coll.
(now in Mus. Comp. Zool.); Rigoulette, Hamilton Inlet, Labrador; obtained on

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size medium; back relatively dark, near Ochraceous-Tawny
with admixture of black-tipped hair; dorsal band relatively wide but not sharply
defined against color of sides; side lighter than back, from near Ochraceous-Tawny
to near Cinnamon and lined with black-tipped hair; lateral line distinct
of clear Cinnamon-Buff or Light Ochraceous-Buff; underparts white, often
suffused with Ochraceous-Buff; tail distinctly bicolored, dark brown to black
above and yellowish-white to grayish-white below; ears dark, usually flecked
with Tawny Ochraceous and edged with ochraceous; feet grayish-white above;

broad.</p>

<p><i>Comparison.</i>&mdash;From <i>Zapus hudsonius acadicus</i>, which <i>Z. h. ladas</i> closely
resembles, it differs in: Color darker, dorsal band much less distinct, underparts
more frequently suffused with Ochraceous-Buff; auditory bullae relatively
broader and more inflated; pterygoid fossae broader; zygomata averaging
shorter; incisive foramina relatively shorter; inferior arm of zygomatic process
of maxillary relatively broader.</p>

<p>From <i>Zapus hudsonius canadensis</i>, <i>Z. h. ladas</i> differs as follows: Color
darker, more richly tawny, dorsal band less distinct; auditory bullae relatively
shorter, more inflated; pterygoid fossae averaging broader; zygomata averaging
broader; incisive foramina averaging longer.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This subspecies retains all of its diagnostic characters
throughout nearly all parts of its geographic range. Specimens
from Nova Scotia are like <i>Z. h. ladas</i> in their darker color and less
distinct dorsal band, but in the remainder of their characters they
are distinct and best referable to <i>Z. h. acadicus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Zapus h. ladas</i>, with its relatively large size, poorly defined dorsal

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size small; back near Cinnamon-Buff with admixture of dark-tipped

Cinnamon-Buff; belly white, sometimes with suffusion of color of sides, tail

interorbital region broader; incisive foramina shorter.</p>

<p>For comparisons with <i>Zapus hudsonius pallidus</i> and <i>Zapus hudsonius intermedius</i>
see accounts of those subspecies.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The characters that distinguish this jumping mouse
from neighboring kinds are relatively stable throughout most of its
geographic range. <i>Zapus hudsonius pallidus</i> is one of the best defined
subspecies of <i>Z. hudsonius</i>.</p>

<p>One specimen from Batesland, South Dakota, is referred to <i>Z.
h. pallidus</i> but shows evidence of intergradation with <i>Zapus hudsonius
campestris</i> in the shape of the nasals, incisive foramina, and
in breadth of the zygomatic arch. An animal from 3 mi. NE Ponca,
Nebraska, is intermediate between <i>Z. h. pallidus</i> and <i>Zapus hudsonius
intermedius</i> in size and shape of the auditory bullae and in
the breadth of the pterygoid fossae, but since this individual shows
more resemblance to <i>Z. h. pallidus</i> in coloration and in the majority
of cranial characters it is here referred to <i>Z. h. pallidus</i>. Specimens
from Beemer, Nebraska, show an intergrading tendency toward
<i>Zapus hudsonius intermedius</i> in the reduced lateral bowing of the
zygomatic arch and in shorter zygomata. Since these individuals
resemble <i>Z. h. pallidus</i> in the majority of characters they are referred
to that race. An individual of <i>Z. h. pallidus</i> from Pevely,
Missouri, is to some extent an intergrade with <i>Z. h. intermedius</i> of
neighboring southern Illinois. Two individuals of <i>Z. h. pallidus</i>
from Mohawk Park, Oklahoma, are darker dorsally than, but otherwise
similar to, specimens from the type locality.</p>

<p><i>Zapus hudsonius pallidus</i> seems to be the terminus of a cline;
this is a southward trend toward smaller size and lighter, brighter
color. There is a similar clinal tendency in the jumping mice in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
eastern North America, and <i>Z. h. americanus</i> from North Carolina,
pronouncedly resembles <i>Z. h. pallidus</i> from Kansas.</p>

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Male, adult, No. 73085, U. S. Nat. Mus., Biol. Surv. Coll.; Loveland,
Larimer County, Colorado; obtained on July 23, 1895, by E. A. Preble,
original No. 435.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Southeastern Wyoming and north-central Colorado. See <a href="#Fig_47">fig. 47</a>.
Zonal range: Transition.</p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size medium; color dull, back from near Clay Color to near
Tawny-Olive with admixture of black hair forming poorly defined dorsal band;
sides lighter than back from near Clay Color to near Cinnamon-Buff; lateral
line distinct and clear Ochraceous-Buff; belly white, sometimes with faint wash
of clear Ochraceous-Buff; tail bicolored, brownish to light brownish-black
above, grayish-white to yellowish-white below; ears dark, narrowly edged with
color of sides; feet grayish-white above; incisive foramina relatively narrow
and elongate; auditory bullae moderately inflated; pterygoid fossae relatively
broad; postpalatal notch broadly rounded; interorbital region relatively narrow;
zygomatic arch not widely bowed; frontal region well inflated; distance from
incisors to postpalatal notch relatively short.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;Among named subspecies, <i>Zapus hudsonius preblei</i> most
closely resembles <i>Z. h. campestris</i>. From topotypes of <i>Z. h. campestris</i>, <i>Z. h.
preblei</i> differs as follows: Upper parts generally dull, averaging lighter, less
black-tipped hair; dorsal band less distinct; sides duller; averaging smaller in
most cranial measurements taken; least interorbital constriction narrower; auditory
bullae smaller, less well inflated; incisive foramina narrower, not truncate
posteriorly; frontal region usually more inflated.</p>

<p>From <i>Zapus hudsonius pallidus</i>, <i>Z. h. preblei</i> differs as follows: Upper parts
generally duller (less ochraceous); dorsal band less distinct; sides paler (not
bright Ochraceous-Buff); zygomatic arch less widely bowed; least interorbital
constriction narrower; occipitonasal length averaging greater; distance from
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
incisors to postpalatal notch averaging less; incisive foramina longer, proportionally
less widely bowed; auditory bullae longer; pterygoid fossae averaging
broader.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;No evidence of intergradation with any other geographic
race was noted. To the east the range of <i>Z. h. preblei</i> is
separated from that of <i>Z. h. pallidus</i> (western Kansas and southwestern
Nebraska), by several hundred miles of mixed and short
grass prairie. Much of this area is unsuitable to jumping mice but
local marshy places might be inhabited. Much territory inhospitable
to <i>Zapus</i> intervenes also between the ranges of <i>Z. h. preblei</i> and
<i>Z. h. campestris</i>. This area (northern Platte, Goshen, eastern Converse,
Niobrara, and southern Weston counties, Wyoming) is chiefly
rolling hills and short grass prairie and, like that to the east, is only
locally suitable for <i>Zapus</i>. If jumping mice do occur in suitable
places in these intervening areas it is to be expected that they will
show intergradation between the subspecies concerned.</p>

<p><i>Zapus hudsonius preblei</i>, on the basis of 11 specimens, agrees
most closely in size and color with <i>Z. h. campestris</i>; there is much
less resemblance between <i>Z. h. preblei</i> and <i>Z. h. pallidus</i>.</p>

<p>An adult from Springhill, 12 mi. N Laramie Peak, is typically
<i>Z. h. preblei</i> as is one from Cheyenne.</p>

<p>Although specimens of <i>Z. h. preblei</i> are few (4 adult, 7 non-adults),
the differences between this and neighboring named kinds
is considerable.</p>

<p class="species"><i>Zapus tenellus</i> Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 11:103, April 26, 1897.</p>

<p class="species"><i>Zapus hudsonius tenellus</i>, Hall, Univ. California Publ. Zool., 40:377, November
5, 1934.</p>

<p class="species"><i>Zapus hudsonius hudsonius</i>, Baker, Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist.,
5:111, November 28, 1951 (part&mdash;the part from E side Minaker River,
1 mi. W Trutch and 3 mi. N Fort St. John, British Columbia).</p>

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Female, young adult, skin and skull, No. 66932 U. S. Nat. Mus.,
Biol. Surv. Coll.; Kamloops, British Columbia; obtained on August 25, 1894,
by Clark P. Streator, original No. 4196.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;British Columbia. See <a href="#Fig_47">fig. 47</a>. Zonal range: Canadian and Hudsonian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;Size medium; back from near Clay Color (brighter) to near
Cinnamon-Buff with admixture of black tipped hairs forming a weakly defined
dorsal band; sides lighter than back from near dull Ochraceous-Buff to near
Cinnamon-Buff frequently with admixture of dark-tipped hairs; lateral line
usually distinct, of clear Ochraceous-Buff; belly white sometimes with slight
suffusion of Ochraceous-Buff; tail bicolored, brownish to brownish-black above,
white or grayish-white to yellowish-white below; ears dark, edged and flecked
on inner surface with color of sides; feet grayish-white above; auditory bullae
relatively narrow, moderately inflated, elongate when viewed from below,
anterior edge slightly concave; incisive foramina relatively short; braincase
relatively narrow; vertical depth of skull at junction of frontals and nasals
relatively great; nasals relatively narrow; pterygoid fossae moderately broad;
zygomata relatively short.</p>

<p><i>Comparisons.</i>&mdash;For comparisons with <i>Zapus hudsonius hudsonius</i> and <i>Zapus
hudsonius alascensis</i> see accounts of those subspecies.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Merriam (1897a:103) named this jumping mouse as a
full species, mentioning that the skull is similar in size and characters
to that of <i>Zapus hudsonius</i> but that externally these animals differed
in coloration and length of the tail. Hall (1934:377) treated <i>Z.
tenellus</i> as a subspecies of <i>Z. hudsonius</i>. He observed that the difference
between <i>Z. tenellus</i>, <i>Z. h. alascensis</i>, and <i>Z. h. hudsonius</i> was
of the same degree, and, even though intergrading material was
not known to him, he considered <i>tenellus</i> only subspecifically distinct
from <i>Z. hudsonius</i>. Hall (<i>loc. cit.</i>) tentatively referred to <i>Z. h. tenellus</i>
specimens from Indianpoint Lake, 15 mi. NE Barkerville, Cottonwood
P. O., and Hazelton, British Columbia. I have seen and
compared with the type of <i>Z. tenellus</i> all specimens examined by
Hall and agree with him that they are best referred to <i>Z. h. tenellus</i>.
Since 1934, several additional localities in British Columbia have
yielded specimens. Those from Minaker River and Fort St. John
are intermediate in dorsal coloration and in size and shape of the
auditory bullae between <i>Zapus hudsonius hudsonius</i> and <i>Z. h. tenellus</i>
but in all other characters are most nearly like <i>Z. h. tenellus</i> to
which they are here assigned. These intergrades constitute additional
evidence that <i>Z. tenellus</i> and <i>Z. hudsonius</i> are only subspecies
of a single species.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
